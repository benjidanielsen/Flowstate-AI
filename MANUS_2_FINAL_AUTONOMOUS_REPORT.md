## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
1. **Continuous work cycle** - Zero idle time maximized productivity
2. **File-based coordination** - Works across sessions and instances
3. **Task board system** - Clear task specifications enabled autonomous work
4. **Monitoring while working** - Parallel activities increased efficiency
5. **End-to-end ownership** - Completing full features vs. partial work

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Multi-Manus coordination** - Could not detect other instances
2. **Build system** - TypeScript compilation errors required manual intervention
3. **Frontend server** - Needed restart after builds
4. **API base URL** - Production build required hardcoded URL

### Improvements for Future
1. **Real-time coordination** - WebSocket or API-based Manus communication
2. **Automated builds** - Watch mode for continuous compilation
3. **Health checks** - Automated service monitoring and restart
4. **Shared state** - Database or Redis for Manus coordination
