# Handoff to Manus: Flowstate-AI System Debugging and Implementation - Updated

Hi Manus,

This document provides an updated summary of the `Flowstate-AI` project, reflecting the current state after initial setup and fixes. The primary objective remains to fully implement and stabilize the `ai_gods` system and execute the development plan located at `collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json`.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective is to fully implement and stabilize the `ai_gods` system. This involves orchestrating a group of AI agents to work together autonomously to manage and develop the project. The master plan for this is generated by `ai_gods/godmode_brain.py` and is located in `collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json`.

## 2. Development Environment

*   **Operating System**: Ubuntu (Sandbox Environment)
*   **Shell**: Bash
*   **Project Root**: `/home/ubuntu/Flowstate-AI`
*   **Python Environment**: A virtual environment is managed by `pipenv` using Python 3.11.
*   **Key Scripts**:
    *   `ai_gods/godmode_orchestrator_v2.py`: The master script that manages the lifecycle of all AI agents and services.

## 3. VS Code Extensions

While a specific `extensions.json` file was not found, the system has a `vscode_agent` (`ai_gods/vscode_agent.py`) and a `vscode_backend_api` (`ai_gods/vscode_backend_api.py`). This implies a deep integration with the VS Code environment is intended. It would be beneficial to ensure the standard **Python** and **Docker** extensions are installed.

## 4. Tokens & Keys

Sensitive keys, tokens, or API credentials are expected to be managed via environment variables. These should be loaded from a `.env` file in the project root. Ensure any necessary API keys (like for OpenAI, GitHub, etc.) are configured.

## 5. Summary of Work and `ls -R` Usage

Initial tasks involved understanding the project structure and goals. A recursive listing of all files was critical for discovering the project's architecture, identifying the central planning mechanism, and locating startup/shutdown scripts. All recent changes have been committed to the `main` branch.

## 6. Current Status of Previously Identified Problems

The following issues have been addressed:

1.  **`godmode_orchestrator_v2.py` Crashing**: The `SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal` in `godmode_orchestrator_v2.py` has been resolved by correcting the docstring and removing extraneous lines.
2.  **`python-worker` API Calls**: The `python-worker/src/main.py` has been updated to use `httpx` for API calls to the Node.js backend, removing direct Python imports of services.
3.  **`__init__.py` Files**: Verified and created `__init__.py` files in `Flowstate-AI/backend/src/services` to ensure proper Python package recognition.
4.  **`godmode-state.json`**: The `godmode-state.json` file has been created/verified with correct port configurations.
5.  **Redis Installation**: Redis server has been installed and started directly in the sandbox environment.
6.  **Frontend Stability**: The frontend `EMFILE: too many open files` error was addressed by increasing the `ulimit -n` to 4096. The frontend is now running in preview mode.

## 7. Current System State

-   Python virtual environment is set up with `pipenv`.
-   Node.js dependencies for root, backend, and frontend are installed.
-   `godmode_orchestrator_v2.py` has been fixed.
-   `__init__.py` files are in place.
-   `python-worker/src/main.py` is updated for HTTP API calls.
-   `godmode-state.json` is correctly configured.
-   Redis server is installed and running.
-   Node.js Backend is running on port 3001.
-   GODMODE Orchestrator is active and all its components are operational.
-   Node.js Frontend is running in preview mode on port 4173.

## 8. New Documentation and Insights

New documentation and insights derived from recent analysis are available in the `Flowstate-AI/docs/` directory. These documents provide summaries of key Manus share links, identified connections and themes, and a comprehensive implementation plan for the Flowstate-AI system, focusing on cost-free, easy-to-create, AI-agent friendly, and hands-free development, including the Frazer Method CRM pipeline.

## 9. Next Steps

Proceed with executing the development plan located at `collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json` and continuously monitor system logs for any errors or instabilities. Refer to the documentation in `Flowstate-AI/docs/` for detailed plans and insights.
