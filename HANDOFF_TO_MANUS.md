# Handoff to Manus: Flowstate-AI System Debugging and Implementation

Hi Manus,

Here is a summary of the current state of the `Flowstate-AI` project, the work done so far, the outstanding issues, and the overall plan.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective is to fully implement and stabilize the `ai_gods` system. This involves orchestrating a group of AI agents to work together autonomously to manage and develop the project. The master plan for this is generated by `ai_gods/godmode_brain.py` and is located in `collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json`.

## 2. Development Environment

*   **Operating System**: Windows
*   **Shell**: Windows PowerShell (`powershell.exe`)
*   **Project Root**: `c:\Flowstate Project\Flowstate-AI`
*   **Python Environment**: A virtual environment is located at `.\.venv`. It should be activated before running any scripts. The startup script handles this automatically.
*   **Key Scripts**:
    *   `scripts/windows/START_FLOWSTATE_WINDOWS.ps1`: The main entry point for launching the entire system.
    *   `scripts/windows/STOP_FLOWSTATE_WINDOWS.ps1`: Stops all running services.
    *   `ai_gods/godmode_orchestrator_v2.py`: The master script that manages the lifecycle of all AI agents and services.

## 3. VS Code Extensions

While a specific `extensions.json` file was not found, the system has a `vscode_agent` (`ai_gods/vscode_agent.py`) and a `vscode_backend_api` (`ai_gods/vscode_backend_api.py`). This implies a deep integration with the VS Code environment is intended. It would be beneficial to ensure the standard **Python** and **Docker** extensions are installed.

## 4. Tokens & Keys

Sensitive keys, tokens, or API credentials are expected to be managed via environment variables. The `scripts/windows/START_FLOWSTATE_WINDOWS.ps1` script is the place to look for how these are loaded. Currently, it sets port configurations, but any necessary API keys (like for OpenAI, GitHub, etc.) should be loaded there, likely from a `.env` file that is not present in the repository. You may need to create a `.env` file in the project root.

## 5. Summary of Work and `ls -R` Usage

My initial task was to understand the project's structure and goals. To do this, I performed the equivalent of an `ls -R` command to get a recursive listing of all files in the workspace. This was absolutely critical for:
1.  Discovering the project's architecture (e.g., the `ai_gods` directory, `python-worker`, various frontends).
2.  Identifying the central planning mechanism (`godmode_brain.py`).
3.  Locating the main startup and shutdown scripts.

Based on this understanding, I generated the master plan and attempted to start the system, which led to the discovery of the issues below. All recent changes have been committed to the `main` branch.

## 6. Current Problems to Be Fixed

The system is currently unstable and fails to launch correctly. Here are the specific problems that need to be resolved:

1.  **`godmode_orchestrator_v2.py` is Crashing**: The orchestrator script is failing with a `SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal`. This happened after I attempted to fix some issues and seems to be related to faulty string replacements in the file's docstrings. The file needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected.

2.  **`python-worker` Port Conflict**: Originally, the `python-worker` service was failing to start due to a port conflict on port 8000 (`[Errno 10048]`). The startup script `START_FLOWSTATE_WINDOWS.ps1` is designed to find a free port and set the `PYTHON_API_PORT` environment variable, which the worker should use. This needs to be verified and fixed to ensure the worker can always start on a free port.

3.  **Unstable Frontend Server**: The logs also indicated that a frontend server was in a restart loop. The cause for this is unknown and needs investigation. Check the logs in `godmode-logs/` for any files related to the frontend.

4.  **Docker Not Running**: The startup script consistently fails to connect to Docker, preventing services like Redis from starting. Please ensure Docker Desktop is running before launching the startup script.

## 7. Recommended Next Steps for Manus

1.  **Fix the Orchestrator**: Carefully inspect `ai_gods/godmode_orchestrator_v2.py` and fix the `SyntaxError`. The file history in git should help revert to a working version.
2.  **Stabilize Core Services**: Start the system again and monitor the logs (`godmode-logs/godmode-orchestrator-v2.log` and individual component logs). Address the `python-worker` port issue and the frontend server instability.
3.  **Ensure Docker is Running**: Make sure your Docker Desktop is running so that containerized services like Redis can be launched by `docker-compose`.
4.  **Execute the GODMODE Plan**: Once the system is stable and all services are running without errors, you can proceed with the main goal: executing the phases outlined in `collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json`.

Good luck!
