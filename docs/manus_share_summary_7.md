# Understanding AI and AGI with Examples

This Manus share link replays a task focused on creating an interactive website to explain AI and AGI with examples (GPT, Grok, Claude, Manus, etc.). The `todo.md` file within the replay outlines a comprehensive plan for this project, covering:

## Research Phase:
- Research AI and AGI concepts and definitions.
- Gather information on popular AI examples and their capabilities/limitations.
- Collect information on the current state of AGI development.

## Website Structure and Design:
- Create basic HTML structure and design with an AI theme.
- Implement dark mode functionality.
- Create CSS styling.

## Interactive Features:
- Implement animated bot cursor.
- Add background animations (Star Wars-inspired robot).
- Create interactive roadmap for AI/AGI concepts.
- Implement daily challenges and progress tracking.

## Content Creation:
- Write comprehensive content on AI and AGI.
- Create detailed sections for each AI example.
- Add interactive images, diagrams, and comparison charts.

## Testing and Deployment:
- Test interactive features, ensure mobile responsiveness, optimize performance.
- Deploy website and present the final product.

This document is highly relevant as it demonstrates a structured approach to explaining complex AI concepts in an interactive and user-friendly manner. This could be directly applied to creating documentation or interactive guides for the Flowstate-AI system, making it more accessible and
