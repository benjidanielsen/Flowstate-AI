# Interactive Webpage on AI Agents with Visuals and Deployment

This Manus share link showcases a task focused on creating an interactive webpage about AI agents, including visuals and deployment. The task involved clarifying requirements from the user, specifically regarding:

- **Target Audience**: Beginners, technical professionals, students.
- **Specific Examples/Case Studies**: Inclusion of AI agents in action.

The user's responses indicate a focus on:
- **"Caar - consigliere as a service - ai home helper"**
- **Visuals**: To be made to look like households.
- **Scope**: All possible.
- **Target Group**: Housewives, total outsiders.

This suggests a user-friendly, visually-oriented approach to presenting AI agent capabilities, potentially for a non-technical audience. This aligns with the goal of making the Flowstate-AI system "easy-to-create" and "AI-agent friendly" by providing clear, accessible interfaces and explanations.
