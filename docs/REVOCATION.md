**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10

## Purpose

This document defines the process for revoking trust in federated AI systems.

## Revocation Triggers

Trust may be revoked when security vulnerabilities are discovered and not addressed, governance violations occur, emergent harmful behavior is detected, or compliance failures happen.

## Revocation Process

1. **Identification:** Issue is identified and documented
2. **Assessment:** Severity and impact are evaluated
3. **Decision:** System Owner decides on revocation
4. **Notification:** Affected parties are notified
5. **Implementation:** Trust relationships are terminated
6. **Documentation:** Revocation is recorded in audit trail

## Reinstatement

Revoked systems may be reinstated after issues are resolved, verification is completed, and System Owner approval is obtained.
