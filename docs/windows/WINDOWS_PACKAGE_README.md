## üéì Understanding the System

### The Four Components

**1. Manus Sync Engine** (Background Process)
- Coordinates multiple AI agents
- Handles task assignment
- Manages conflict resolution
- Monitors system health

**2. Godmode Dashboard** (Port 3333)
- Real-time AI agent monitoring
- Shows what each agent is doing
- Progress bars and metrics
- WebSocket live updates

**3. Backend API** (Port 3001)
- TypeScript/Express server
- Handles business logic
- Manages database (SQLite)
- Provides REST API

**4. Frontend** (Port 3000)
- React web interface
- Customer management
- Frazer Method pipeline
- Interaction tracking

### How They Work Together

```
Frontend (3000) ‚Üí Backend API (3001) ‚Üí Database
                       ‚Üë
                       |
Godmode Dashboard (3333) monitors AI Agents
                       ‚Üë
                       |
Manus Sync Engine coordinates everything
```

All four components need to be running for the system to work properly.
