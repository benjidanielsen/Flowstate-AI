# ADR 0012: Federation Readiness for Multi-Tenant Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Flowstate-AI is designed to operate as an autonomous AI system that can evolve and adapt independently. As the system matures, there is potential value in enabling it to participate in federated AI networks where multiple autonomous instances can collaborate, share learnings, and coordinate actions while maintaining independence and security.

### Current Situation

The system currently operates as a standalone instance with:
- Autonomous operation capabilities
- Self-modification and evolution features
- Comprehensive governance framework
- Security and audit mechanisms
- Supply chain security (SLSA Level 3)

However, it lacks:
- Multi-tenant architecture support
- Federation protocols and APIs
- Inter-instance communication mechanisms
- Shared learning infrastructure
- Federated governance models
- Cross-instance security verification

### Requirements

1. **Multi-Tenant Support**: Enable multiple isolated instances within a single deployment
2. **Federation Protocols**: Define how instances discover, authenticate, and communicate
3. **Shared Learning**: Enable knowledge sharing while preserving privacy
4. **Security**: Ensure federated operations don't compromise security
5. **Governance**: Extend governance framework to federated scenarios
6. **Gradual Adoption**: Support both standalone and federated modes

## Decision

We will prepare Flowstate-AI for federation readiness by implementing a multi-tenant architecture foundation, defining federation protocols, and establishing the governance framework for federated operations. Initial implementation will focus on preparation rather than active federation, allowing the system to participate when appropriate.

### Federation Architecture

**Multi-Tenant Foundation**:
- Tenant isolation at database, application, and resource levels
- Tenant-specific configuration and customization
- Shared infrastructure with isolated data
- Per-tenant metrics and monitoring
- Tenant lifecycle management (provisioning, suspension, deletion)

**Federation Protocols**:
- Instance discovery and registration
- Mutual authentication using cryptographic signing
- Secure communication channels (mTLS)
- API contracts for inter-instance communication
- Versioned protocol support for compatibility

**Shared Learning Infrastructure**:
- Federated learning capabilities for model training
- Privacy-preserving knowledge sharing (differential privacy)
- Aggregated insights without raw data exposure
- Opt-in/opt-out mechanisms per tenant
- Learning contribution attribution

### Security Model

**Trust Establishment**:
- Cryptographic signing of all releases (cosign)
- SLSA Level 3 provenance verification
- SBOM validation for dependency transparency
- Continuous security monitoring
- Revocation mechanisms for compromised instances

**Isolation Guarantees**:
- Network isolation between tenants
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control and authentication per tenant
- Resource quotas and rate limiting
- Audit logging of all cross-tenant interactions

**Threat Model**:
- Malicious tenant attempting to access other tenant data
- Compromised instance in federation
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on federation communication
- Data poisoning in federated learning
- Resource exhaustion attacks

### Governance for Federation

**Federation Participation Criteria**:
- System Owner approval required
- Security audit completion
- Governance framework compliance
- Ethics policy adherence
- Technical requirements met (SLSA, SBOM, signing)

**Federated Decision-Making**:
- Local autonomy preserved for tenant-specific decisions
- Federated consensus for shared resources or policies
- Escalation paths for conflicts
- Emergency disconnect procedures

**Compliance and Audit**:
- Per-tenant compliance tracking
- Federation-wide audit trail
- Cross-instance activity logging
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response coordination

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Multi-Tenant Foundation** (Current Phase K):
- Database schema with tenant isolation
- Tenant management APIs
- Configuration per tenant
- Resource isolation and quotas
- Tenant-specific monitoring

**Phase 2: Federation Protocols** (Future):
- Instance discovery service
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure communication channels
- API contracts and versioning
- Health checking and monitoring

**Phase 3: Shared Learning** (Future):
- Federated learning infrastructure
- Privacy-preserving aggregation
- Knowledge sharing APIs
- Contribution tracking
- Opt-in/opt-out management

**Phase 4: Production Federation** (Future):
- Live federation with trusted partners
- Cross-instance coordination
- Shared resource management
- Federated governance implementation
- Continuous improvement based on learnings

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: No Federation Support

**Pros**:
- Simpler architecture
- No federation complexity
- Easier to secure
- Lower operational overhead

**Cons**:
- Missed collaboration opportunities
- No shared learning benefits
- Limited scalability options
- Isolated evolution

**Decision**: Rejected - Federation provides significant long-term value for autonomous AI systems.

### Alternative 2: Full Federation from Day One

**Pros**:
- Maximum collaboration potential
- Immediate shared learning
- Network effects from start

**Cons**:
- High complexity upfront
- Security risks before maturity
- Premature standardization
- Resource intensive

**Decision**: Rejected - Too risky without proven standalone operation.

### Alternative 3: Gradual Federation Readiness (Chosen)

**Pros**:
- Balanced approach
- Reduces risk through phases
- Allows learning and adaptation
- Maintains standalone viability

**Cons**:
- Longer timeline to full federation
- Some rework may be needed
- Requires ongoing investment

**Decision**: Accepted - Best balance of risk and opportunity.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Future-Proof Architecture**: System ready for federation when appropriate
2. **Multi-Tenant Capability**: Enables SaaS deployment model
3. **Shared Learning Potential**: Can benefit from collective intelligence
4. **Scalability**: Federation enables horizontal scaling beyond single instance
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple instances can coordinate on complex tasks
6. **Resilience**: Federation provides redundancy and fault tolerance

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**: Multi-tenant and federation add architectural complexity
2. **Security Surface**: More attack vectors to protect against
3. **Operational Overhead**: More monitoring, management, and coordination required
4. **Performance Impact**: Isolation and security mechanisms add overhead
5. **Governance Complexity**: Federated decision-making is more complex

### Neutral

1. **Optional Feature**: Federation is opt-in, not required
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Can be implemented incrementally
3. **Standards Evolution**: Federation protocols will evolve over time
