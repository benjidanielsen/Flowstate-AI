# ADR-0001: Phase 0 Baseline Establishment

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Deciders:** System Owner, Technical Lead  
**Technical Story:** Phase 0 baseline establishment before Phase A execution

## Context and Problem Statement

The Flowstate-AI execution plan (Phases A-K) assumes a production-ready baseline with specific files, configurations, and infrastructure already in place. Upon inspection of the repository, many of these foundational elements were found to be missing or incomplete. How do we establish the necessary baseline infrastructure before proceeding with Phase A?

## Decision Drivers

* Phase A (Baseline Verification) cannot proceed without baseline files existing
* Documentation portal requires mkdocs.yml and complete documentation structure
* Deployment phases require organized Docker and database migration frameworks
* Governance and ethics frameworks must be established before autonomous operations
* Federation readiness requires comprehensive documentation and audit trails
* Security policy must be defined before production deployments

## Considered Options

1. Proceed with Phase A and create files as needed during execution
2. Create a new Phase 0 to establish baseline before Phase A
3. Modify Phase A to include baseline establishment

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Create a new Phase 0 to establish baseline before Phase A", because it provides a clear separation of concerns, ensures all prerequisites are met before verification begins, and maintains the integrity of the original execution plan structure.

### Positive Consequences

* Clear baseline is established before any verification or testing
* All subsequent phases can proceed as documented without modification
* Documentation structure is complete and ready for MkDocs portal
* Docker and database frameworks are organized and ready for use
* Governance and ethics frameworks are in place from the start
* Audit trail begins from Phase 0, providing complete history

### Negative Consequences

* Adds 2-3 days to the overall timeline
* Requires updating the execution plan to include Phase 0
* Creates additional work before "visible" progress begins

## Implementation Details

### Phase 0 Components

**Runtime Version Files** include .nvmrc (Node 20) and .python-version (Python 3.11) for deterministic runtime environments.

**Security and Governance** encompasses SECURITY.md (vulnerability reporting), .github/CODEOWNERS (code ownership), and comprehensive governance and ethics documentation.

**Documentation Infrastructure** consists of mkdocs.yml (portal configuration), docs/INDEX.md (homepage), and complete documentation templates for all required files.

**Docker Organization** involves moving docker-compose.yml to docker/compose.yml, creating docker/.env.shared template, and establishing docker/otel-collector.yaml for observability.

**Database Framework** includes db/migrations/ directory structure, db/.dbmate configuration, and 0001_init.sql initial migration.

**Architecture Decision Records** comprise docs/adr/ directory structure, ADR template (0000-template.md), and this ADR documenting Phase 0 decision.

### Files Created

The following baseline files were created during Phase 0 execution:

**Configuration Files:** .nvmrc, .python-version, .github/CODEOWNERS

**Security:** SECURITY.md

**Documentation Portal:** mkdocs.yml, docs/INDEX.md

**Governance:** docs/GOVERNANCE.md, docs/ETHICS.md, docs/AUDIT_TRAIL.md

**Operations:** docs/OPS_RUNBOOK.md, docs/DR_RUNBOOK.md, docs/SLOS.md, docs/QUALITY.md

**Federation:** docs/FEDERATION_CHARTER.md, docs/EMERGENT_BEHAVIOUR_OVERSIGHT_AND_CESSATION.md, docs/RISK_REGISTER.md, docs/FEDERATION_CHECKLIST.md, docs/REVOCATION.md

**Development:** docs/CHANGELOG.md, docs/adr/0000-template.md, docs/adr/0001-phase-0-baseline-establishment.md

**Docker:** docker/compose.yml, docker/.env.shared, docker/otel-collector.yaml

**Database:** db/.dbmate, db/migrations/0001_init.sql
