# ADR 0010: Disaster Recovery Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Production systems require comprehensive disaster recovery (DR) planning to ensure business continuity in the event of system failures, data loss, or catastrophic events. Without proper DR procedures, organizations face extended downtime, data loss, and potential business failure.

### Current Situation

The Flowstate-AI project has basic backup procedures but lacks:
- Comprehensive disaster recovery runbook
- Defined recovery time and point objectives
- Tested recovery procedures
- Automated backup and restoration scripts
- Communication plans for incidents
- Regular DR testing schedule

### Requirements

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime
2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss
3. **Backup Strategy**: Automated, tested, and reliable backups
4. **Recovery Procedures**: Step-by-step runbooks for all scenarios
5. **Testing**: Regular validation of DR procedures
6. **Communication**: Clear plans for internal and external communication

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy with RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 1 hour, covering all critical failure scenarios with tested procedures and automated tooling.

### Recovery Objectives

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours maximum  
- Database failure: 2 hours
- Application failure: 30 minutes
- Complete outage: 4 hours

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour maximum  
- Database: 15 minutes (continuous transaction logs)
- Files: 1 hour (hourly sync)
- Configuration: 0 (stored in Git)

These objectives balance business requirements with technical feasibility and cost.

### Disaster Scenarios

We define and document recovery procedures for five primary scenarios:

#### 1. Database Failure
Complete loss of database service due to hardware failure, corruption, or misconfiguration.

**Recovery**: Promote standby replica or restore from backup within 2 hours.

#### 2. Application Server Failure
Loss of application servers due to hardware failure, software bugs, or resource exhaustion.

**Recovery**: Automatic failover to healthy servers within 30 minutes.

#### 3. Complete Data Center Outage
Loss of entire primary data center due to natural disaster, power outage, or network failure.

**Recovery**: Activate DR site in secondary region within 4 hours.

#### 4. Data Corruption
Logical corruption of data due to software bugs, human error, or malicious activity.

**Recovery**: Restore from last known good backup within 2 hours.

#### 5. Security Breach
Unauthorized access, data exposure, or system compromise.

**Recovery**: Immediate containment, full recovery within 8 hours.

### Backup Strategy

**Database Backups**:
- Full backup: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- Incremental backup: Every 6 hours
- Transaction logs: Continuous streaming
- Retention: 30 days daily, 90 days weekly, 1 year monthly
- Storage: Primary and secondary regions plus long-term archival

**Application Backups**:
- Configuration: Git repository with tags
- Container images: GitHub Container Registry
- User files: Object storage with versioning and replication

**Backup Verification**:
- Automated restore test: Weekly
- Manual verification: Monthly
- Integrity checks: Daily

### Recovery Procedures

Each disaster scenario has detailed step-by-step procedures including:
- Assessment and diagnosis
- Recovery actions with commands
- Verification steps
- Post-recovery tasks
- Communication requirements

All procedures are documented in the DR Runbook with executable commands and scripts.

### Testing Schedule

**Monthly**: Backup restoration test to verify backups are valid  
**Quarterly**: Failover test to standby systems  
**Annually**: Full DR site activation and failback

Test results are documented and procedures are updated based on lessons learned.

### Communication Plan

**Internal**:
- Automated alerts to on-call engineer
- Status updates every 30 minutes during incidents
- Post-mortem within 1 week

**External**:
- Status page updates
- User notifications via email and in-app
- Incident reports published within 24 hours

### Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Overall responsibility and decision-making
- **Technical Lead**: Executes recovery procedures
- **Communications Lead**: Manages all communications
- **On-Call Engineer**: First responder and initial assessment

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: No Formal DR Plan

**Pros**:
- No upfront investment
- No ongoing maintenance

**Cons**:
- Extended downtime during incidents
- Potential data loss
- Uncoordinated recovery efforts
- Business risk

**Decision**: Rejected - Unacceptable business risk.

### Alternative 2: Manual DR Procedures Only

**Pros**:
- Flexibility
- Lower initial cost

**Cons**:
- Slow recovery
- Error-prone
- Requires expert knowledge
- Not scalable

**Decision**: Rejected - Too slow and unreliable.

### Alternative 3: Fully Automated DR

**Pros**:
- Fastest recovery
- Minimal human intervention
- Consistent execution

**Cons**:
- Very expensive
- Complex to implement
- May not handle all scenarios
- Requires significant infrastructure

**Decision**: Rejected - Cost not justified for current scale.

### Alternative 4: Documented + Semi-Automated DR (Chosen)

**Pros**:
- Balance of speed and cost
- Automated where it matters most
- Human oversight for critical decisions
- Scalable and maintainable

**Cons**:
- Requires regular testing
- Some manual steps remain

**Decision**: Accepted - Best balance for our needs.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Business Continuity**: Minimize downtime and data loss
2. **Confidence**: Team knows what to do during incidents
3. **Compliance**: Meets regulatory and contractual requirements
4. **Customer Trust**: Demonstrates commitment to reliability
5. **Reduced Stress**: Clear procedures reduce panic during incidents
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular testing identifies weaknesses

### Negative

1. **Cost**: Infrastructure for backups, DR site, and testing
2. **Maintenance**: Procedures must be kept up-to-date
3. **Testing Overhead**: Regular DR tests consume resources
4. **Complexity**: More systems and procedures to manage

### Neutral

1. **RTO/RPO Targets**: May need adjustment based on business needs
2. **Backup Retention**: Balance between cost and compliance
3. **Testing Frequency**: May increase as system criticality grows

## Metrics

Track and improve:
- **RTO Achievement**: Actual vs. target recovery time
- **RPO Achievement**: Actual vs. target data loss
- **Backup Success Rate**: Percentage of successful backups
- **Restore Success Rate**: Percentage of successful restores
- **Test Completion**: Percentage of scheduled tests completed

## Review and Evolution

This strategy will be reviewed:
- After every disaster recovery event
- Quarterly as part of operational review
- Annually as part of business continuity planning
- When RTO/RPO requirements change
