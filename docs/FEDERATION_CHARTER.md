# Federation Charter

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10

## Purpose

This charter establishes the framework for Flowstate-AI participation in federated AI systems.

## Federation Principles

Federated AI systems enable multiple autonomous AI instances to collaborate while maintaining independence. Flowstate-AI may participate in federation when it provides clear value to users and meets security and governance requirements.

## Requirements for Federation

### Technical Requirements

- Signed releases with SLSA provenance
- Manifest file with parent hash chain
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Documented API contracts
- Security audit completion

### Governance Requirements

- Approved governance framework
- Ethics policy in place
- Audit trail maintained
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Revocation process defined

## Federation Participation

Participation in federated networks requires explicit approval from the System Owner and compliance with all technical and governance requirements.

## Trust Model

Trust in federated systems is established through cryptographic signing, provenance verification, manifest validation, and continuous monitoring.
