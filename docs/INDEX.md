# Flowstate-AI Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **Flowstate-AI**, an AI-first, self-improving CRM-OS designed for network marketers and solo founders.

## Overview

Flowstate-AI is a cutting-edge customer relationship management and operations system that leverages artificial intelligence to continuously learn, adapt, and optimize its performance. Built with the "Birth and Rebirth" paradigm, the system evolves autonomously while maintaining human oversight as an advisory role.

### Key Features

**Frazer Pipeline Method** enforces a strict, proven sales pipeline methodology that guides users through systematic customer relationship management.

**Customer Card System** provides comprehensive tracking of customer interactions, history, and relationship status in an intuitive interface.

**Intelligent Reminder System** automatically schedules and optimizes follow-up reminders based on customer behavior patterns and historical data.

**Next Best Action (NBA) Engine** uses AI-driven recommendations to surface the most impactful actions for each customer relationship at any given time.

**GODMODE Brain** offers a comprehensive monitoring dashboard that provides real-time visibility into system health, AI decision-making, and operational metrics.

**Self-Improvement Capabilities** enable the system to analyze its own performance, identify improvement opportunities, and evolve its algorithms autonomously.

## Architecture

Flowstate-AI is built on a modern, microservices-based architecture that ensures scalability, maintainability, and continuous evolution.

### Technology Stack

The **Frontend** is built with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface.

The **Backend** uses Node.js with Express and TypeScript, backed by SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production environments.

The **Python AI Worker** implements FastAPI to handle AI-driven reminder processing and Next Best Action calculations.

The **Godmode Dashboard** is a Python Flask application with Flask-SocketIO for real-time monitoring and system oversight.

**Containerization** is achieved through Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring consistent deployment across all environments.

**CI/CD** is powered by GitHub Actions, providing automated testing, building, and deployment pipelines.

## Project Philosophy

Flowstate-AI embodies the principle of **Autonomy First, Human Advisory**, where the system operates independently by default with human intervention being optional rather than required. This approach enables continuous development and evolution while maintaining appropriate safeguards through bounded operating parameters, transparent decision records, and emergency override mechanisms.

The system follows the **Birth and Rebirth** paradigm, viewing AI development as a cyclical process of learning, adaptation, and self-modification rather than a linear path to a final version. Systems maintain their core identity while constantly transforming to better serve user needs.
