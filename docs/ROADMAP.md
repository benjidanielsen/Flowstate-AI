- **Automated Workflows**: GitHub Actions automate repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and issue triage.
- **Transparent Collaboration**: All agent activities, including code changes and task progress, are visible on GitHub.
- **Version Control**: Git is used for tracking changes to code, documentation, and configurations.

### Implementation Plan for New Features

1.  **Frazer Pipeline Method Implementation**:
    -   Extend database schema for `pipelines`, `stages`, and `pipeline_analytics` tables.
    -   Develop a dedicated `PipelineAgent` in the Python worker to manage pipeline progression.
    -   Integrate with `AgentService` and `WorkflowOrchestrationService` for automated stage transitions and recommendations.

2.  **Customer Card System Development**:
    -   Create a new `customers` table in Supabase for comprehensive customer profiles.
    -   Update `AgentService` and `MemoryService` to handle customer profile creation, updates, and interaction logging.
    -   Implement a `CustomerAgent` to manage specific customer-related tasks, including advanced filtering and next step tracking.

3.  **Intelligent Reminder System Integration**:
    -   Develop a `ReminderAgent` responsible for scheduling, processing, and escalating reminders.
    -   Leverage the existing `job_queue` and `agent_states` for reminder management and execution.
    -   Create a dedicated UI for managing reminders directly from customer profiles.

4.  **Next Best Action (NBA) Engine Development**:
    -   Enhance the `LearningAgent` to generate AI-powered recommendations based on customer data and behavior.
    -   Utilize the `VectorSearchService` for efficient retrieval of relevant recommendations.
    -   Potentially create a `recommendations` table to store and manage NBA suggestions.

5.  **Event Logging & Analytics Implementation**:
    -   Extend the `documents` table or create a new `events` table for detailed JSON-based logging of all customer interactions and system events.
    -   Develop new backend services and API endpoints for log processing, querying, and advanced analytics.
    -   Create an `AnalyticsAgent` for generating data-driven insights and monitoring pipeline effectiveness.

6.  **AI Agent Self-Improvement Enhancements**:
    -   Further develop the `LearningAgent` to implement advanced iterative feedback loops and self-evaluation mechanisms.
    -   Integrate automated GitHub issue creation for performance issues identified by agents, triggering human or AI intervention.
