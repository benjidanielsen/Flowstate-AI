# Flowstate-AI v2030 Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development for Flowstate-AI v2030, building upon the successfully implemented core agent architecture, Supabase integration, inter-agent communication, memory systems with vector embeddings, and advanced workflow orchestration.

## Current Status

The core architecture and foundational components are successfully implemented, including:

-   Supabase database schema with `pgvector` for vector embeddings.
-   Backend services for agent management, job processing, memory, and vector search.
-   Python worker with a base agent class and several specialized agents.
-   Inter-agent communication and workflow orchestration mechanisms.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1.  **Fix Backend TypeScript Compilation**:
    -   Resolve Router type inference issues
    -   Update database manager to use Supabase connection
    -   Test backend startup

2.  **Deploy and Test Full Stack**:
    -   Start backend server
    -   Start Python worker
    -   Run comprehensive test suite
    -   Verify inter-agent communication

3.  **Add OpenAI API Key**:
    -   Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment
    -   Test embedding generation
    -   Verify semantic search functionality

### Short-Term Enhancements

1.  **Authentication and Authorization**:
    -   Implement JWT-based authentication
    -   Add role-based access control
    -   Secure API endpoints

2.  **Enhanced Monitoring**:
    -   Add Prometheus metrics
    -   Implement health check dashboard
    -   Set up alerting system

3.  **Performance Optimization**:
    -   Implement connection pooling
    -   Add caching layer (Redis)
    -   Optimize vector search queries

4.  **Additional Agents**:
    -   Customer Interaction Agent
    -   Sales Intelligence Agent
    -   Reporting Agent
    -   Integration Agent

### Long-Term Goals

1.  **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    -   GitHub Actions for automated testing
    -   Automated deployment to production
    -   Database migration automation

2.  **Advanced AI Capabilities**:
    -   Fine-tuned models for specific tasks
    -   Multi-modal understanding (text, images, audio)
    -   Reinforcement learning for agent improvement

3.  **Scalability**:
    -   Horizontal scaling of worker instances
    -   Load balancing
    -   Distributed job queue

4.  **User Interface**:
    -   Admin dashboard for agent management
    -   Workflow builder UI
    -   Real-time monitoring dashboard
