## Key Principles and Directives

### Core Principles
1. **Quality over Speed**: Always prioritize robustness and reliability
2. **Continuous Operation**: Project runs until August 7, 2026
3. **Agent Autonomy**: Work towards self-sustaining AI agent system
4. **Local Runnability**: Easy setup and development experience
5. **Scalability**: Handle 100,000+ tasks efficiently

### User Directives
- "Quality over speed always. Rule number one."
- "Speed is good when everything is perfect."
- "You are not done before 07/AUGUST/2026"
- "There should be at least 100.000 tasks made"
- "Stay consistent."
- "The agents must learn and the brain should function without us at one point."

## Maintenance and Updates

### Update Frequency
- **PROGRESS_LOG.md**: Updated regularly (daily or upon significant progress)
- **Master Strategic Plan v2**: Updated as needed when major strategic changes occur
- **Other documents**: Reference documents, updated only if significant new information emerges

### Version Control
- All documents are versioned and backed up
- Major changes to strategic documents should create new versions (e.g., v3)
