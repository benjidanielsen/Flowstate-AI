# Audit Trail

**Purpose:** This document maintains a chronological record of all significant system changes, decisions, and interventions for accountability and traceability.

**Format:** Each entry follows the format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC | Event Type | Actor | Description | Reference`

### Phase 0: Baseline Establishment

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | BASELINE | System | Phase 0 baseline establishment initiated | phase-0/baseline-establishment**

Phase 0 initiated to create foundational infrastructure required before Phase A execution. This includes runtime version files, documentation templates, GitHub configuration, and Docker/database organization.

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | CONFIG | System | Created .nvmrc for Node 20 version pinning | .nvmrc**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | CONFIG | System | Created .python-version for Python 3.11 version pinning | .python-version**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | SECURITY | System | Created SECURITY.md with security policy and vulnerability reporting procedures | SECURITY.md**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | GOVERNANCE | System | Created .github/CODEOWNERS defining code ownership | .github/CODEOWNERS**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | DOCUMENTATION | System | Created mkdocs.yml for documentation portal configuration | mkdocs.yml**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | DOCUMENTATION | System | Created docs/INDEX.md as documentation homepage | docs/INDEX.md**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | GOVERNANCE | System | Created docs/GOVERNANCE.md establishing governance framework | docs/GOVERNANCE.md**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | ETHICS | System | Created docs/ETHICS.md establishing ethical guidelines | docs/ETHICS.md**

### Phase A: Baseline Verification

**2025-10-10 01:00:00 UTC | BASELINE | System | Phase A baseline verification initiated | chore/baseline-probe**

Phase A initiated to verify that all CI workflows pass and baseline infrastructure is functional. This phase will audit existing workflows, identify issues, and ensure the system is ready for subsequent phases.

**2025-10-10 01:00:00 UTC | AUDIT | System | Auditing existing GitHub Actions workflows | .github/workflows/**

Discovered workflows:
- ci.yml (226 lines) - Main CI/CD pipeline with backend, frontend, and Python worker tests
- docker.yml (71 lines) - Docker image building and Trivy security scanning
- main.yml (72 lines) - Cross-platform build and test workflow
- backend-tests.yml (545 bytes) - Backend-specific test workflow

**2025-10-10 01:00:00 UTC | ISSUE | System | Identified YAML formatting issues in ci.yml | .github/workflows/ci.yml**

The ci.yml workflow has severe indentation problems that will cause workflow failures. The YAML structure is malformed with inconsistent indentation levels.

## Audit Trail Guidelines

### Event Types

- **BASELINE** - Foundational infrastructure establishment
- **CONFIG** - Configuration changes
- **SECURITY** - Security-related changes
- **GOVERNANCE** - Governance policy changes
- **ETHICS** - Ethics policy changes
- **DEPLOYMENT** - Deployment events
- **MIGRATION** - Database migration events
- **INCIDENT** - Security or operational incidents
- **INTERVENTION** - Human override or intervention
- **EVOLUTION** - Autonomous system evolution events
- **ROLLBACK** - Rollback of previous changes
- **AUDIT** - Audit and verification activities
- **ISSUE** - Problems or issues identified

### Actor Types

- **System** - Autonomous system actions
- **Human:[Name]** - Human-initiated actions
- **CI/CD** - Automated pipeline actions
- **External** - External system or service actions

### Reference Format

References should point to relevant artifacts such as Git commit hashes, PR numbers, issue numbers, workflow run IDs, or incident report IDs.

**2025-10-10 02:00:00 UTC | COMPLETE | System | Phase A baseline verification completed successfully | phase_a_verification_report.md**

Phase A has been completed. All GitHub Actions workflows are now properly formatted, functional, and executing. The CI/CD pipeline is successfully detecting code quality issues.

**Summary of Phase A accomplishments:**
- Fixed critical YAML formatting issues in ci.yml (complete rewrite)
- Created codeql.yml for security analysis
- Updated backend-tests.yml to Node 20
- Resolved npm cache configuration issues
- Changed npm ci to npm install (no package-lock.json in repo)
- Integrated Gitleaks secret scanning
- Added commitlint for conventional commits validation

**Findings:**
- Pre-existing TypeScript compilation errors in backend code
- 16 security vulnerabilities identified by Dependabot (6 high, 10 moderate)
- Workflows are functional and successfully detecting issues

**Next Steps:**
- Fix backend TypeScript compilation errors (separate PR)
- Address security vulnerabilities (separate PR)
- Proceed with Phase B: Supply Chain Security
