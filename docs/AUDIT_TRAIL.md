### Phase 0: Baseline Establishment

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | BASELINE | System | Phase 0 baseline establishment initiated | phase-0/baseline-establishment**

Phase 0 initiated to create foundational infrastructure required before Phase A execution. This includes runtime version files, documentation templates, GitHub configuration, and Docker/database organization.

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | CONFIG | System | Created .nvmrc for Node 20 version pinning | .nvmrc**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | CONFIG | System | Created .python-version for Python 3.11 version pinning | .python-version**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | SECURITY | System | Created SECURITY.md with security policy and vulnerability reporting procedures | SECURITY.md**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | GOVERNANCE | System | Created .github/CODEOWNERS defining code ownership | .github/CODEOWNERS**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | DOCUMENTATION | System | Created mkdocs.yml for documentation portal configuration | mkdocs.yml**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | DOCUMENTATION | System | Created docs/INDEX.md as documentation homepage | docs/INDEX.md**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | GOVERNANCE | System | Created docs/GOVERNANCE.md establishing governance framework | docs/GOVERNANCE.md**

**2025-10-10 00:00:00 UTC | ETHICS | System | Created docs/ETHICS.md establishing ethical guidelines | docs/ETHICS.md**

### Phase A: Baseline Verification

**2025-10-10 01:00:00 UTC | BASELINE | System | Phase A baseline verification initiated | chore/baseline-probe**

Phase A initiated to verify that all CI workflows pass and baseline infrastructure is functional. This phase will audit existing workflows, identify issues, and ensure the system is ready for subsequent phases.

**2025-10-10 01:00:00 UTC | AUDIT | System | Auditing existing GitHub Actions workflows | .github/workflows/**

Discovered workflows:
- ci.yml (226 lines) - Main CI/CD pipeline with backend, frontend, and Python worker tests
- docker.yml (71 lines) - Docker image building and Trivy security scanning
- main.yml (72 lines) - Cross-platform build and test workflow
- backend-tests.yml (545 bytes) - Backend-specific test workflow

**2025-10-10 01:00:00 UTC | ISSUE | System | Identified YAML formatting issues in ci.yml | .github/workflows/ci.yml**

The ci.yml workflow has severe indentation problems that will cause workflow failures. The YAML structure is malformed with inconsistent indentation levels.
