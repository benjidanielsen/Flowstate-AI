# **üåê Flowstate-AI ‚Äì Intelligent CRM / Living System**

## **üß≠ Purpose**

Flowstate-AI is an **AI-first CRM operating system**, specifically designed for **network marketers and solo entrepreneurs**. It enforces structured activity flows based on the **Frazer Method** (Talk ‚Üí Invite ‚Üí Show ‚Üí Keep Talking) and integrates a **self-evolving AI improvement loop**. Its core purpose is to minimize administrative overhead and maximize **Income-Producing Activity (IPA)**.

---

## **üåç Vision**

Flowstate-AI is evolving into a **self-improving living system** that continuously learns, adapts, and empowers humans to reach their highest potential through intelligent automation and personalized guidance.

---

## **üîÑ Iterative Process & Quality Assurance**

The system undergoes a rigorous iterative development process to ensure it becomes **idiot-proof, elegant, scalable, and future-ready**.

Each iteration involves recursive stress-tests (e.g., **100√ó100 ‚Üí 1M√ó1M simulations**) that measure **robustness, scalability, and pipeline integrity**.

| Methodology | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Backtest** | Historical, simulated user journeys. |
| **Front-test** | Edge-cases with synthetic data. |
| **Cross-check** | Validate backend logic against frontend expectations. |
| **Refinement & Re-run** | Implement fixes and immediately re-run tests. |
| **Documentation Update** | Log all findings, changes, and results. |

## **üìñ Documentation Standards**

* **System Design Notes:** Architecture, logic flow, and AI evolution.  
* **Process Reports:** Documenting stress-test results and performance.  
* **Improvement Logs:** Tracking refinements and changes per iteration.  
* **Blueprints:** Visuals and logic mapping for system components.

## **üß© Core Components & Operational Logic**

### **Pipeline Engine (State-Machine)**

The engine strictly enforces the Frazer Method using **state-machine logic** and **guardrails** to prevent deviations.

| Stage (Ordered) | Operational Logic / Guardrail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Nytt Lead** | Start samtale / bygg relasjon. |
| **Relationship Building** | AI suggests **Avdekk Why** (Uncover Prospect's Why). |
| **Invited** | AI suggests **Bekreft invitasjon**. |
| **Qualified** | **Requires `Prospect's Why` field to be filled**; transition rejected otherwise. |
| **Presentation Sent** | **Automatically creates one (1) follow-up task** (due ‚âà \+24‚Äì48h) upon first transition. |
| **Follow-up** | AI suggests **Avklar sp√∏rsm√•l ‚Üí mot beslutning**. |
| **Team Member** | AI suggests **Onboarding**. |

### **Prospect Management**

* **Minimal Input:** Name, Platform.  
* **Customer Card (Kundekort):** Comprehensive view including Profile, Notes, Interactions, and **Next Step**.  
* **AI Summary:** Provides AI-generated scores on **relationStrength**, **interest**, and **urgency**.

### **Reminder System (Automation)**

Automated reminders are powered by **cron jobs / task schedulers** to maximize follow-through:

| Trigger | Reminder Logic |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Video Sent** | 24h / 48h reminders. |
| **No-Show** | 2h / 1d reminders. |
| **Inactivity** | 7+ day reminders. |

### **Dashboard (Action-Board)**

* **100% Action-Oriented:** Displays **Daily Method of Operation (DMO) Goals** (e.g., 20 conversations, 30 follow-ups, 5‚Äì10 invites, 3‚Äì5 presentations).  
* Includes a **Progress bar** for goal achievement.  
* Features an **AI-prioritized task list (Next Best Action \- NBA)**.

### **Feedback & Logging**

* **JSON-based event logs:** Captures all system activities and interactions.  
* **Feedback Button:** Available system-wide for user reports.  
* **Categories:** Logs are categorized as **Error, Bug, Suggestion, Idea, or Critical**.

### **Improvement Engine**

* **Input:** Processes all system logs and user feedback.  
* **Processing:** Performs categorization, priority scoring, and clustering of issues.  
* **Output:** Generates **Developer Reports (Markdown/JSON)** with prioritized, actionable tasks.  
* Runs **mini stress-tests** on proposed changes **before** implementation to ensure system stability.
