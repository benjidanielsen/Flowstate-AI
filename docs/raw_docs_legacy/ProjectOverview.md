    \*   \*\*Focus for AI/Developers:\*\* \*\*Critical for understanding detailed requirements, architectural decisions, and known gaps/risks.\*\* This is where you'll find the most comprehensive technical specifications.  
\*   \*\*\`FlowstateAI\_CRM\_Phase1\_Beta.md\`\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Description:\*\* Provides details on the initial beta phase of the CRM, including specific features and goals for that phase.  
    \*   \*\*Focus for AI/Developers:\*\* Useful for understanding \*\*early implementation details and the evolution of the system\*\*.

\#\#\# Frazer Brookes Method Integration

\*   \*\*\`FrazerMethod\_SystemBlueprint.md\`\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Description:\*\* Outlines the system blueprint for integrating the Frazer Brookes recruiting challenge/method into Flowstate-AI.  
    \*   \*\*Focus for AI/Developers:\*\* \*\*Crucial for understanding the business logic of the pipeline, stage definitions, and specific rules\*\* related to prospect progression.  
\*   \*\*\`FrazerMethod\_Summary.md\`\*\*  
    \*   \*\*Description:\*\* A concise summary of the Frazer Brookes method.  
    \*   \*\*Focus for AI/Developers:\*\* A quick reference for the \*\*key concepts of the Frazer Method\*\* without diving into extensive detail.

\#\#\# Technical & Development Aspects

\*   \*\*\`FlowstateAI\_Developer\_FAQ\`\*\* (or your chosen new name)  
    \*   \*\*Description:\*\* This document contains a comprehensive set of developer-focused questions and answers, providing in-depth clarity on the Flowstate-AI system and its integration with the Frazer Brookes method.  
    \*   \*\*Focus for AI/Developers:\*\* \*\*Highly relevant for technical deep-dives into UI/UX, data models, state management, performance, error handling, and future extensibility.\*\*
