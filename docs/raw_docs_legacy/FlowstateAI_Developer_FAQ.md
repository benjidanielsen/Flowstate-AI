# **Flowstate-AI: Developer FAQ \- Merged and Consolidated**

This document compiles a comprehensive set of developer-focused questions and their answers, providing in-depth clarity on the **Flowstate-AI system** and its integration with the **Frazer Brookes method**.

## **1\. Core Principles and Business Logic**

| Question | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| **What are the core non-negotiable principles of the Affiliate Network Marketing CRM?** | The core principles are: **AI-first** CRM operating system; **Designed for network marketers** and solo entrepreneurs; **Enforces structured activity flows** (Frazer Method); Integrates an **AI improvement loop** for robustness and self-evolution; Focus on minimizing admin and maximizing **Income Producing Activity (IPA)**; 100% **action-oriented Dashboard** ("Action-Board"); Continuous **self-refinement** via stress tests and feedback loops; and a **Built-in AI assistant** without external API costs initially. |
| **What are the foundational principles or philosophies behind Frazer Brookes' recruitment flow that drive its effectiveness?** | The flow is driven by the **Daily Method of Operation (DMO)**: Talk to People, Invite Them, Show Them, Keep Talking to Them. It also emphasizes **Self-Leadership and Time Management**, the **Prospecting System** (Define "Who," Find "Where," Daily Action "What"), the **"Ping-Pong" Method** (3-5 messages for rapport), the **Three-Question Funnel** for qualifying, and a presentation system focusing on three core prospect questions. |
| **What is the proposed plan for implementing the CRM to minimize work for the user (minimize admin / maximize IPA)?** | The plan includes: **Automated reminders and follow-ups**; an **AI-driven improvement engine** that suggests developer actions; an **AI-prioritized task list / Next Best Action (NBA)** on the Dashboard; a "Kundekort" (prospect card) with an **"Analyser & Oppdater"** (Analyze & Update) button for suggestions; and AI-driven coaching and automation like **"No-show" Handling** and **Automatic Video-oppfølging**. |
| **What are the key benefits and drawbacks of using the existing FlowState OS (custom app) compared to an Airtable solution?** | **Benefits (FlowState OS):** AI-first design, structured activity flows (Frazer Method), AI improvement loop, automated reminders/follow-ups, and a self-improving "living system" tailored for network marketers. **Drawbacks (FlowState OS Beta):** Single-user only (no team mode), lightweight AI models (early phase), limited feedback engine, and GDPR compliance not yet fully completed. |

## **2\. System Architecture and Technology Stack**

| Question | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| **If a backend is introduced, what architectural patterns and technologies are being considered?** | **Backend:** **Node.js** with **Express**. **AI Layer:** **Python** (for scoring, reminders, prioritization). **Automation:** **CronJobs / Task Scheduler**. **Logging:** JSON logs \+ Markdown reports. **Infrastructure:** **Cloud-ready** with **microservices planned in later phases**. **Policy:** Serverside **TypeScript-only** for new code. |
| **What is the chosen frontend framework and how is code modularity and reusability maintained?** | The frontend is based on **React.js \+ Tailwind CSS**. React.js inherently promotes **component-based modularity and reusability**, a shift from any earlier Vanilla JS approach. |
| **What type of database will be used for a potential backend, and what is the high-level persistence plan?** | **Database Type:** **PostgreSQL** (for production) and **SQLite** (for beta). The plan for persistence is a shift from client-side localStorage to **server-side persistence** (PostgreSQL/SQLite) to handle larger datasets and future multi-device synchronization. |

## 

## **3\. Data Model and Persistence**

| Question | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Can you provide a detailed data model for the core entities (Prospects, Tasks, Logs, Goals)?** | **Prospect:** id (UUID), name, platform, stage (enum: "Nytt Lead" → "Team Member"), why (required for Qualified), notes, **AI scores** (relationStrength, interest, urgency), updatedAt, createdAt. **Task (Reminder):** id (UUID), prospectId (FK), kind (followup, noshow, inactivity, custom), title, dueAt, completedAt. **Interaction / Logg:** id, prospectId (FK), ts, type (note, status-change, message, call, meeting), payload. **FeedbackEvent:** id, ts, author, level (Error, Bug, etc.), message. **Goals:** Implies a mechanism to track and store **DMO goals** (e.g., 20 new conversations) and their progress, likely linked to user activity. |
| **How are prospect interactions (calls, emails, meetings) explicitly modeled and stored?** | Interactions are stored within the **Interaction / Logg** entity, explicitly using the type attribute: "note", "status-change", "message", "call", or "meeting". Additional details (like stage changes) are included in the payload field. |
| **How is data integrity ensured when using localStorage, and what is the plan for more robust persistence?** | The focus for data integrity appears to be shifting towards the planned database solutions (**PostgreSQL/SQLite**). The document does not explicitly detail how integrity is ensured for the remaining/temporary use of localStorage. Server-side persistence with PostgreSQL is the long-term plan for robustness. |
| **How will the system differentiate between a prospect's "status" (Phase 1\) and their "stage" (Phase 2 Frazer pipeline)?** | The Prospect data model uses a dedicated **stage** field with predefined enumerated values ("Nytt Lead", "Relationship Building", etc.) that directly reflect the Frazer pipeline. The user will primarily see **stage**, which implies the old "status" concept will be replaced or mapped during migration. |

| **Are there specific UI component libraries, routing, or state management plans beyond the base framework?** | **UI Components:** The base is **React.js \+ Tailwind CSS**. Specific libraries (Material UI, Ant Design) are not explicitly mentioned but are commonly used with React. **Routing:** Not explicitly defined, but a React environment typically uses a library like **React Router** for client-side routing (managing views without full page reloads). **State Management:** Not explicitly defined, but for complex state beyond simple objects, libraries like Redux, Vuex, or Zustand would be considered for global application state. |
| **What are the plans for form management, validation, and a sophisticated in-app notification system?** | **Form/Validation:** No specific libraries are mentioned, but they are planned to streamline complex forms (e.g., dedicated form management and validation libraries). **Notifications:** Beyond simple toasts, a more sophisticated in-app notification system (e.g., a notification center for critical alerts/reminders) is planned to enhance the **Reminder System**. |
| **How will data visualization be implemented for the dashboard's ticker, goals, and pipeline widgets?** | **Data Visualization Libraries:** Specific libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, ApexCharts) are mentioned as possibilities, but the final choice is not yet specified. The goal is to use them to create **interactive and informative charts** for **DMO Goals** and pipeline metrics. |
| **What content is in the prospect card's "Info" tab, and what AI-scripts are in the "Handlinger" (Actions) tab?** | The "Info" tab will display **"grundinfo"** (basic profile data) including name, platform, why?, notes, and **AI-generated scores** for relationStrength, interest, and urgency. The **"Handlinger"** (Actions) tab will feature an **"Analyser & Oppdater"** (Analyze & Update) button, implying **AI-driven quick actions/scripts** to update scores and guide the user to the prospect's **Next Best Action**. |
| **How is the visual progression and mapping of the pipeline achieved?** | The **pipelineStages array** is defined by the enumerated, ordered values in the Prospect data model's **stage** field ("Nytt Lead" → "Team Member"). This array is directly mapped to the visual representation of the progress bar. Clear visual feedback on stage movement will be provided via the **Dashboard** and the **clickable progress bar** on the "Kundekort." The underlying logic for **stageColors gradient** is not detailed but must ensure clear distinction and accessibility. |
| **What mechanisms are in place for the sticky topbar and preventing user confusion between the Dashboard and Prospect Card?** | The feature for a **"sticky topbar with Quick Search \+ Quick Note"** is mentioned but its implementation details are not specified. Preventing confusion between the Dashboard's **NBA carousel** and the individual **Prospect Cards** requires **clear UI/UX design** but no specific mechanisms are detailed in the plan. |

## **5\. AI Engine and Automation**

| Question | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Can you detail the specific algorithms or rules used by the "AI hint" in the NBA engine beyond simple stage-based logic?** | The **Next Best Action (NBA) Engine** uses **AI-prioritized tasks** and an **AI summary** per prospect, considering data points like **relationStrength**, **interest**, and **urgency** (all AI-generated scores). The logic provides stage-specific suggestions (e.g., "Relationship Building → Avdekk Why," "Follow-up → Avklar spørsmål → mot beslutning"). |
| **How is the NBA logic and the getNextBestAction() function designed to be extensible?** | The logic is designed for extensibility through the **Improvement Engine**, which takes **Logs \+ Feedback**, performs categorization/clustering/scoring, and outputs **Developer Reports**. This continuous feedback loop and iterative stress-testing allows the underlying Python-based getNextBestAction() function to be **easily updated or extended** as the Frazer method evolves or new best practices emerge. |
| **How are task priorities determined, and what other types of automated tasks are envisioned?** | Task priorities are **AI-determined** (AI-prioritert) and driven by the **NBA engine**. Tasks are created automatically by the **Reminder System** based on triggers and specific timeframes, including: **"Presentation Sent" follow-ups** (24–48h), **"No-show" Handling** (2h/1d follow-ups), and **General reminders for "Inactivity"** (7+ days). |
| **How is the "Prospect's Why" field utilized by the NBA engine, and are there plans to analyze this data?** | The **"Prospect's Why"** is a **critical qualification gate** (required for the "Qualified" stage). It is actively used by the NBA engine, which suggests **"Avdekk Why"** (Uncover Why) during "Relationship Building." The **Improvement Engine**'s processing capabilities (Categorization, scoring, clustering) could be used to **aggregate and analyze "Why" data** to identify common motivations or patterns among prospects. |

## **Frazer Brookes Method Deeper Dive (Recap from 1 & 11\)**

| Question | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Can you provide a more detailed breakdown of the "Relationship Building" stage within the Frazer pipeline?** | The stage is centered on the **"Ping-Pong" Method** (3-5 back-and-forth messages) to build rapport. Successful progression is primarily defined by the AI's suggestion to **"Avdekk Why"** (Uncover Why), which is the key action before inviting them to the next stage. |
| **What does "continuation" specifically entail in the "Follow-up" stage?** | Continuation in the "Follow-up" stage entails **"Avklar spørsmål → mot beslutning"** (Clarify questions → towards decision). This ensures the user actively addresses the prospect's concerns and guides them to a clear next step (decision) rather than letting the conversation stall. |
| **What are the key "qualifying questions" or criteria used in the "Qualified" stage?** | The absolute key criterion is the presence of the **"Prospect's Why"** (required field). The broader process involves the **Three-Question Funnel** (Ask the question, Ask "Why", Ask "What") to efficiently identify qualified leads. |

Here are the answers to your developer-focused questions, based on the provided FlowState AI system design document:1. Core Principles and Business Logic

* **Core non-negotiable principles of the Affiliate Network Marketing CRM:**  
  * AI-first CRM operating system.  
  * Designed for network marketers and solo entrepreneurs.  
  * Enforces structured activity flows (Frazer Method).  
  * Integrates an AI improvement loop for robustness and self-evolution.  
  * Focus on minimizing admin and maximizing Income Producing Activity (IPA).  
  * Intuitive design based on principles from leaders like Frazer Brookes.  
  * Built-in AI assistant without external API costs initially.  
  * 100% action-oriented Dashboard ("Action-Board") with daily goals and AI-prioritized tasks.  
  * Continuous self-refinement via stress tests and feedback loops.  
* **Key benefits and drawbacks of using the existing FlowState OS (custom app) compared to an Airtable solution:**  
  * **Benefits (FlowState OS):** AI-first design, structured activity flows (Frazer Method), AI improvement loop, automated reminders/follow-ups, AI-driven improvement engine, gamified UI, AI-prioritized tasks, and a self-improving "living system" that continuously learns and adapts. It's a tailored solution for network marketers and solo entrepreneurs.  
  * **Drawbacks (FlowState OS Beta):** Single-user only (no team mode), lightweight AI models (early phase), limited feedback engine, and GDPR compliance not yet fully implemented. The document doesn't explicitly detail drawbacks compared to Airtable, but the limitations suggest areas where a more mature, off-the-shelf solution like Airtable might currently offer broader functionality or multi-user support.  
* **Proposed plan for implementing the CRM to minimize work for the user:**  
  * The system is designed to be an all-in-one solution for Network Marketing, minimizing admin and maximizing Income Producing Activity (IPA).  
  * Automated reminders and follow-ups.  
  * AI-driven improvement engine that analyzes logs and feedback to suggest concrete developer actions, leading to a self-improving system.  
  * AI-prioritized task list / Next Best Action (NBA) on the Dashboard.  
  * "Kundekort" (pop-up window) with an "Analyser & Oppdater" (Analyze & Update) button to update scores and suggest next actions.  
  * AI-driven Coaching (pop-up messages), "No-show" Handling (auto-create follow-up tasks), and Automatic Video-oppfølging (auto-create 48h follow-up task).  
* **Foundational principles or philosophies behind Frazer Brookes' recruitment flow that drive its effectiveness:**  
  * Daily Method of Operation (DMO): Talk to People, Invite Them, Show Them, Keep Talking to Them.  
  * Self-Leadership and Time Management: Set Time, Protect Time, Use Affirmations, Track Progress (activity-based).  
  * Prospecting System: Define Ideal Prospect ("Who"), Find Prospects ("Where"), and Daily Action Plan ("What").  
  * Four Types of Conversations with specific scripts for each group: Known (never spoken), Known (haven't spoken in a while), Followers, New People (Who, Where system).  
  * "Ping-Pong" Method for relationship building (3-5 back-and-forth messages before business discussion).  
  * Three-Question Funnel for qualifying prospects: Ask the question, Ask "Why", Ask "What".  
  * Transition questions to move from chat to business discussion (e.g., "Just curious...", "Options", "Pain").  
  * Presentation system focusing on three core prospect questions: "What do I actually do?", "Can I do it?", "What if I succeed?".  
* **Detailed breakdown of the "Relationship Building" stage within the Frazer pipeline and criteria for successful progression:**  
  * The document mentions the "Ping-Pong" Method for relationship building, aiming for 3-5 back-and-forth messages before business discussion. This builds rapport and avoids premature sales pitches.  
  * The NBA logic for "Relationship Building" suggests "Avdekk Why" (Uncover Why). This implies that understanding the prospect's motivation is a key criterion for progression.  
* **Key "qualifying questions" or criteria used in the "Qualified" stage to determine if a prospect is a good fit for a presentation:**  
  * The system enforces that the "Qualified" stage requires a filled-in "Prospect's Why." If not, the transition is rejected with user feedback. This is a critical criterion.  
  * The "Three-Question Funnel" (Ask the question, Ask "Why", Ask "What") is integrated for qualifying prospects, efficiently identifying qualified leads.  
* **Other follow-up questions or strategies recommended in the "Follow-up" stage to guide a prospect towards a decision (beyond "What did you like best?"):**  
  * The NBA for "Follow-up" suggests "Avklar spørsmål → mot beslutning" (Clarify questions → towards decision). This implies strategies would involve addressing concerns and guiding the prospect to a clear next step. The document does not explicitly list other specific questions, but the focus is on clarifying and moving towards a decision.  
* **What "continuation" specifically entails in the "Follow-up" stage, and how it ensures a logical next step rather than a dead end:**  
  * The NBA for "Follow-up" indicates "Avklar spørsmål → mot beslutning" (Clarify questions → towards decision). This suggests that continuation involves actively addressing prospect questions and guiding them through a decision-making process, preventing the conversation from stalling.

2\. System Architecture and Technology Stack

* **Backend Architecture and Technologies:**  
  * **Backend:** Node.js \+ Express.  
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL (prod) / SQLite (beta).  
  * **AI Layer:** Python (scoring, reminders, prioritization).  
  * **Automation:** CronJobs / Task Scheduler.  
  * **Logging:** JSON logs \+ Markdown reports.  
  * **Infra:** Cloud-ready; microservices planned in later phases.  
  * **Policy:** Serverside TypeScript-only for new code.

3\. Data Model and Persistence

* **Detailed ERD for core data entities (Prospects, Tasks, Logs, Goals), including attributes, data types, and explicit relationships:**  
  * **Prospect:**  
    * id: string (UUID)  
    * name: string  
    * platform?: string (e.g., Messenger/IG/Phone)  
    * stage: "Nytt Lead" | "Relationship Building" | "Invited" | "Qualified" | "Presentation Sent" | "Follow-up" | "Team Member"  
    * why?: string (required for Qualified)  
    * notes?: string  
    * relationStrength?: "low" | "med" | "high" (AI)  
    * interest?: "low" | "med" | "high" (AI)  
    * urgency?: "low" | "med" | "high" (AI)  
    * updatedAt: string (ISO)  
    * createdAt: string (ISO)  
  * **Task (Reminder):**  
    * id: string (UUID)  
    * prospectId: string (relationship to Prospect)  
    * kind: "followup" | "noshow" | "inactivity" | "custom"  
    * title: string (e.g., "Følg opp presentasjon for \<navn\>")  
    * dueAt: string (ISO, typically \+24–48h from Presentation Sent)  
    * createdAt: string (ISO)  
    * completedAt?: string (ISO)  
  * **Interaction / Logg:**  
    * id: string  
    * prospectId: string (relationship to Prospect)  
    * ts: string (ISO)  
    * type: "note" | "status-change" | "message" | "call" | "meeting"  
    * payload?: any (e.g., { from: "stageA", to: "stageB" })  
  * **FeedbackEvent:**  
    * id: string  
    * ts: string  
    * author: "user" | "system"  
    * level: "Error" | "Bug" | "Suggestion" | "Idea" | "Critical"  
    * message: string  
    * context?: any (optional)  
  * **Goals:** While not explicitly detailed as a data model, the Dashboard section mentions "DMO-mål" (DMO goals) like "20 new conversations," "30 follow-ups," etc., and a "Progress bar for måloppnåelse." This implies a mechanism to track and store these goals and their progress, likely linked to user activity.  
* **How prospect interactions (calls, emails, meetings) are explicitly modeled and stored:**  
  * Prospect interactions are modeled and stored within the Interaction entity.  
  * Attributes include id, prospectId, ts (timestamp), type ("note", "status-change", "message", "call", "meeting"), and an optional payload for additional details (e.g., { from: "stageA", to: "stageB" } for status changes).  
* **Plans for server-side persistence or a more robust client-side database beyond** localStorage**:**  
  * The document states "Database: PostgreSQL (prod) / SQLite (beta)", indicating server-side persistence with PostgreSQL for production and SQLite for beta. This goes beyond localStorage for robust data handling.  
* **How data integrity is ensured when using** localStorage**:**  
  * The document does not explicitly detail how data integrity is ensured when using localStorage. Given the plans for PostgreSQL/SQLite, localStorage might be used for temporary or non-critical data, or it might be a remnant from an earlier design phase. The focus for data integrity appears to be shifting towards the database solutions.  
* **Database type and high-level schema for a potential backend:**  
  * **Database Type:** PostgreSQL (for production) and SQLite (for beta). These are both relational (SQL) databases.  
  * **High-level Schema:** The data models for Prospect, Task, Interaction, and FeedbackEvent (detailed above) provide a high-level schema, outlining the tables and their key attributes. Relationships are implied through prospectId in Task and Interaction.  
* **How the system will differentiate between a prospect's "status" (Phase 1\) and their "stage" (Phase 2 Frazer pipeline) in the data model and presentation to the user:**  
  * The Prospect data model explicitly uses a stage field with predefined values like "Nytt Lead", "Relationship Building", "Invited", etc., which directly reflect the Frazer pipeline stages.  
  * The document mentions "How will the system handle the migration of existing Phase 1 "status" data to the new Phase 2 Frazer "stage" data," implying that "status" was an earlier concept that will be replaced or mapped to "stage" in the current design. The user will primarily see "stage" as the representation of a prospect's position in the pipeline.

4\. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

* **UI component libraries or design systems being considered:**  
  * **Frontend:** React.js \+ Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps in building custom designs, and React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The document doesn't explicitly mention specific UI component libraries like Material UI or Ant Design, but React.js is often used with such libraries.  
* **Client-side routing implementation:**  
  * The document mentions "Client-Side Routing: How will client-side routing be implemented to manage different views (Dashboard, Pipeline, Prospect Card) without full page reloads?" but does not provide a specific answer within the provided text. Given the use of React.js, a common approach would be to use a library like React Router.  
* **Form management and validation libraries:**  
  * The document mentions "Form Management & Validation Libraries: For more complex forms (e.g., adding new prospects with many fields), are there plans to use dedicated form management and validation libraries to streamline development and improve user experience?" but does not provide a specific answer within the provided text.  
* **Notification system enhancements:**  
  * The document mentions "Notification System Enhancements: Beyond simple toasts, are there plans for a more sophisticated in-app notification system (e.g., persistent notifications, notification center) for critical alerts or reminders?" but does not provide a specific answer within the provided text. The "Reminder System" is powered by cron jobs/schedulers and triggers reminders for "Video Sent," "No-Show," and "Inactivity."  
* **Data visualization libraries for the dashboard's ticker, goals, and pipeline widgets:**  
  * The document mentions "Data Visualization Libraries: For the dashboard's ticker, goals, and pipeline widgets, are there any specific data visualization libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, ApexCharts) being considered to create interactive and informative charts?" but does not provide a specific answer within the provided text.  
* **Code modularity and reusability with Vanilla JS, HTML, and Tailwind CSS, and plans for a reactive framework:**  
  * The document explicitly states "Frontend: React.js \+ Tailwind CSS", so it is not using Vanilla JS, HTML, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. React.js inherently promotes component-based modularity and reusability.  
* **How UI components are designed to be truly reusable:**  
  * Given the use of React.js, UI components would be designed as reusable React components, encapsulating their own logic and rendering. The document doesn't provide specific examples of component design, but the framework itself encourages reusability.  
* **Implementation of the "sticky topbar with Quick Search \+ Quick Note":**  
  * The document mentions this feature but does not provide details on its implementation.  
* **Content and functionality of the "Info" tab within the prospect card ("grundinfo"):**  
  * The "Kundekort" (Customer Card) includes "Profile · Notes · Interactions · Next Step". The "Info" tab would likely display the prospect's basic profile information (name, platform, why?, notes), along with AI-generated scores for relationStrength, interest, and urgency.  
* **Specific "AI-scripts" or "quick actions" envisioned for the "Handlinger" (Actions) tab in the prospect card:**  
  * The "Kundekort" includes an "Analyser & Oppdater" (Analyze & Update) button to update scores and suggest next actions. This implies AI-driven quick actions to guide the user through the pipeline. The document doesn't list specific "AI-scripts" but focuses on the AI's role in suggesting next steps.  
* **How the system provides clear visual feedback when a prospect successfully moves from one stage to another:**  
  * The Dashboard features a "Progress bar \+ AI-prioritized tasks" and the "Pipeline View showing prospects in each stage." The "Kundekort" also has a clickable progress bar. These visual elements would likely provide feedback on stage transitions.  
* **Mechanisms in place to prevent user confusion when navigating between the NBA carousel on the dashboard and individual prospect cards:**  
  * The document mentions "AI-prioritert oppgaveliste / Next Best Action (NBA)" on the Dashboard and the "Kundekort" for individual prospects. The integration of these two would need clear UI/UX design, but the document does not explicitly detail mechanisms to prevent confusion.  
* **How the** pipelineStages **array is defined and mapped to the visual representation of the progress bar:**  
  * The Prospect data model explicitly defines the stage as an enumerated type with ordered values: "Nytt Lead" → "Relationship Building" → "Invited" → "Qualified" → "Presentation Sent" → "Follow-up" → "Team Member". This array directly defines the stages, which would then be visually mapped to the progress bar.  
* **Underlying logic for generating the** stageColors **gradient and ensuring clear visual distinction and accessibility:**  
  * The document mentions stageColors but does not provide the underlying logic for generating the gradient or how accessibility is ensured.

5\. AI Engine and Automation

* **Specific algorithms or rules used by the "AI hint" in the NBA engine beyond simple stage-based logic:**  
  * The NBA engine uses "AI-prioritized tasks" and "AI-oppsummering pr. prospect (relasjonsstyrke, interesse, hastverk)" (AI summary per prospect: relation strength, interest, urgency).  
  * The AI hint considers data points beyond stage and tasks, including relationStrength, interest, and urgency from the prospect's AI summary.  
  * The NBA logic provides specific suggestions for each stage:  
    * **Nytt Lead** → Start samtale / bygg relasjon  
    * **Relationship Building** → Avdekk *Why*  
    * **Invited** → Bekreft invitasjon  
    * **Qualified** → Send presentasjon / book møte  
    * **Presentation Sent** → Følg opp innen 24–48 t  
    * **Follow-up** → Avklar spørsmål → mot beslutning  
    * **Team Member** → Onboarding  
* **How the NBA logic is designed to be extensible:**  
  * The "Improvement Engine" takes "Logs \+ Feedback" as input, performs categorization, scoring, and clustering, and outputs "Developer Reports." It also "Runs mini-stress tests before implementing fixes." This suggests an extensible design where new rules or machine learning models can be integrated based on continuous feedback and testing. The getNextBestAction() function is designed to be easily updated or extended as the Frazer method evolves or new best practices emerge.  
* **How task priorities are determined and mechanisms to re-prioritize tasks dynamically:**  
  * The Dashboard includes "AI-prioritert oppgaveliste / Next Best Action (NBA)", indicating that task priorities are determined by the AI.  
  * The "Reminder System" triggers tasks based on events like "Video Sent," "No-Show," and "Inactivity" with specific timeframes (e.g., 24h/48h, 2h/1d, 7+ days).  
  * The Task data model includes dueAt, which suggests tasks can be prioritized by their due dates. The NBA engine's dynamic nature implies re-prioritization.  
* **Other types of automated tasks or workflows envisioned beyond "Presentation Sent" follow-ups:**  
  * "No-show" Handling (auto-create follow-up tasks).  
  * Automatic Video-oppfølging (auto-create 48h follow-up task).  
  * General reminders for "Inactivity" (7+ days).  
  * The "Improvement Engine" aims to automate refinements from logs.  
* **How the "Prospect's Why" field is utilized by the NBA engine or other parts of the system:**  
  * The "Prospect's Why" is explicitly required for a prospect to transition to the "Qualified" stage.  
  * The NBA logic for "Relationship Building" suggests "Avdekk Why" (Uncover Why).  
  * The "Prospect's Why" field is actively used by the NBA engine to generate more personalized and effective "Next Best Actions" by informing the suggestions for relationship building and qualification.  
* **Plans to categorize or analyze the "Why" data:**  
  * The "Improvement Engine" includes "Processing: Categorization, scoring, clustering" of "Logs \+ Feedback." While not explicitly stated for "Why" data, this engine could potentially categorize and analyze the "Why" data to identify common motivations or patterns among prospects, especially as the AI layer evolves.  
* **How the** getNextBestAction() **function is designed to be easily updated or extended:**  
  * The document implies that the getNextBestAction() function is part of the AI layer (Python) and is designed to evolve with the system's iterative process and improvement engine. The continuous feedback loop and stress-testing would allow for updates and extensions to this function as new insights or best practices emerge from the Frazer method.

6\. Performance and Scalability

* **Current performance bottlenecks identified, especially regarding the** x100 Process Walkthrough**:**  
  * The document mentions "Each iteration stress-tests design and logic" and "Recursive process runs (100×100 → 1M×1M)." This indicates that stress-testing is a core part of identifying bottlenecks related to large-scale operations like the "x100 Process Walkthrough." The document doesn't explicitly list *current* bottlenecks but highlights the methodology for finding them.  
* **How the system will scale to handle thousands or tens of thousands of prospects without degrading performance:**  
  * The system aims to be "Scalable" and "Future-ready."  
  * The "Iterative Process" involves "Recursive process runs (100×100 → 1M×1M)" and "Stress-test (scalable simulations)" to ensure scalability.  
  * The backend uses PostgreSQL (prod), which is a robust and scalable database.  
  * "Infra: Cloud-ready; mikrotjenester planlagt i senere faser" (microservices planned in later phases) suggests a microservices architecture for future scalability.  
* **Plans to implement code splitting and lazy loading:**  
  * The document mentions "Code Splitting & Lazy Loading: To optimize initial load times, are there plans to implement code splitting and lazy loading for different parts of the application?" but does not provide a specific answer within the provided text. Given the use of React.js, these are common optimization techniques that would likely be considered.  
* **Specific performance testing methodologies and tools:**  
  * **Testmetodikk (per iterasjon):**  
    * **Stress-testing:** Recursive process runs (100×100 → 1M×1M) measuring robustness, scalability, and pipeline integrity.  
    * **Backtesting:** Historical, simulated user journeys.  
    * **Front-testing:** Edge-cases with synthetic data.  
    * **Cross-checking:** Validate backend logic against frontend expectations.

7\. Testing and Quality Assurance

* **Strategy for automated unit, integration, and end-to-end testing:**  
  * **Testmetodikk (per iterasjon):**  
    * **Stress-testing:** Recursive process runs (100×100 → 1M×1M) measuring robustness, scalability, and pipeline integrity.  
    * **Backtesting:** Historical, simulated user journeys.  
    * **Front-testing:** Edge-cases with synthetic data.

11\. Frazer Brookes Method Specifics (Integration & Implementation)

* **Specific "onboarding checklist" items triggered when a prospect reaches the "Team Member" stage:**  
  * The NBA for "Team Member" is "Onboarding," implying an onboarding checklist. The specific items are not detailed in the document.  
* **How the system handles prospects who deviate from the linear Frazer pipeline flow:**  
  * The "Pipeline Engine" uses "State-machine prevents skipping steps," and "Ingen hopp mellom ikke-tilstøtende steg" (No jumps between non-adjacent steps). This suggests a strict linear flow, and deviations would likely be prevented or require specific actions to revert to an earlier, valid stage.  
* **Acceptance criteria for successfully moving a prospect from one Frazer pipeline stage to the next:**  
  * "Ingen hopp mellom ikke-tilstøtende steg" (No jumps between non-adjacent steps).  
  * "Qualified krever utfylt *Prospect’s Why*; ellers avvis transisjon med brukerfeedback" (Qualified requires filled-in *Prospect's Why*; otherwise, reject transition with user feedback).  
  * "Første overgang til *Presentation Sent* skal opprette én (1) follow-up-task (forfall ≈ \+24–48h) hvis den ikke allerede finnes for samme prospect" (First transition to *Presentation Sent* shall create one (1) follow-up task (due ≈ \+24–48h) if it doesn't already exist for the same prospect).  
* **Key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics tracked for each Frazer pipeline stage:**  
  * The Dashboard shows "DMO-mål" (DMO goals) like "20 new conversations," "30 follow-ups," "5–10 invites," "3–5 presentations," and a "Progress bar for måloppnåelse." These are KPIs for overall activity.  
  * The "Pipeline View" shows prospects in each stage, allowing for tracking of conversion rates or bottlenecks between stages.  
  * "AI-oppsummering pr. prospect" (relation strength, interest, urgency) provides metrics at the individual prospect level.  
* **How data from the "Prospect's Why" field is aggregated and analyzed:**  
  * The "Improvement Engine" processes "Logs \+ Feedback" with "Categorization, scoring, clustering." This engine could be used to aggregate and analyze "Why" data to identify common motivations or pain points.  
* **Kind of reporting and analytics available to users:**  
  * The Dashboard provides "Progress bar for måloppnåelse" and "AI-prioritert oppgaveliste / Next Best Action (NBA)."  
  * "Pipeline View showing prospects in each stage" and an "Activity-feed."  
  * The document also mentions "Reporting & Analytics" as part of the backend & AI engine architecture.  
* **Data points considered essential for the "Ticker" and "Goals" widgets on the dashboard:**  
  * **Ticker:** Not explicitly detailed, but likely real-time activity counts or progress updates.

What are the primary goals for the Flowstate-AI system from a developer's perspective? How does the Pipeline Engine enforce the Frazer Method and what does it prevent? What are the three main phases of the Flowstate-AI development roadmap?

Here are the answers to your questions about the Flowstate-AI system:

**1\. Primary goals for the Flowstate-AI system from a developer's perspective:**

The primary goals for the Flowstate-AI system from a developer's perspective are:

* Strict activity/pipeline flow (no skipping steps).  
* Automated reminders and follow-up.  
* An AI-driven improvement engine that analyzes logs/feedback and produces developer reports.  
* Continuous self-refinement via stress tests and feedback loops.

**2\. How the Pipeline Engine enforces the Frazer Method and what it prevents:**

The Pipeline Engine enforces the Frazer Method using state-machine logic. This logic ensures that prospects move through a predefined, ordered sequence of stages: "Nytt Lead" → "Relationship Building" → "Invited" → "Qualified" → "Presentation Sent" → "Follow-up" → "Team Member". It prevents users from skipping steps in the pipeline. For example, a prospect cannot move to "Qualified" without the "Prospect's Why" field being filled.

**3\. Three main phases of the Flowstate-AI development roadmap:**

The three main phases of the Flowstate-AI development roadmap are:

* **Phase 1: Foundation** (completed) \- Includes core folder structure, logging and documentation standards, and initial stress-test methodology.  
* **Phase 2: Blueprinting & Architecture** \- Involves defining AI core modules (input, reasoning, memory, output), designing API integration points (CRM, dashboards), and mapping UX flows.  
* **Phase 3: MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) \- Focuses on a basic logging system, a simulation engine, and the first CRM-to-AI adapter.

What are the core components of the Flowstate-AI system?

The core components of the Flowstate-AI system are:

* **Pipeline Engine:** Enforces the Frazer Method (Talk → Invite → Show → Keep Talking) with state-machine logic to prevent skipping steps. It also handles CRUD operations on prospects stored in the database.  
* **Prospect Management:** Features minimal input for prospects (Name, Platform), a Customer Card (Profile, Notes, Interactions, Next Step), and AI summaries for relation, interest, and urgency.  
* **Reminder System:** Provides automated reminders based on triggers like "Video Sent" (24h/48h), "No-Show" (2h/1d), and "Inactivity" (7+ days), powered by cron jobs/schedulers.  
* **Dashboard:** Displays the Daily Method of Operation (DMO) goals (e.g., 20 new conversations, 30 follow-ups), a progress bar for goal achievement, and AI-prioritized tasks.  
* **Feedback & Logging:** Uses JSON-based logs and a feedback button for user reports, categorized as Error, Bug, Suggestion, Idea, or Critical. These logs are fed into the Improvement Engine.  
* **Improvement Engine:** Takes logs and feedback as input, processes them through categorization, scoring, and clustering, and outputs Developer Reports (Markdown/JSON). It also runs mini-stress tests before implementing fixes.

How does the Pipeline Engine enforce the Frazer Method, and what specific rules or guardrails are in place to prevent deviations?

The Pipeline Engine enforces the Frazer Method by using state-machine logic that prevents users from skipping steps in the recruiting flow.

Specific rules and guardrails in place to prevent deviations include:

* **Strict Stage Progression:** The system ensures that prospects move through a predefined, ordered sequence of stages: "Nytt Lead" (New Lead) → "Relationship Building" → "Invited" → "Qualified" → "Presentation Sent" → "Follow-up" → "Team Member." It explicitly states "Ingen hopp mellom ikke-tilstøtende steg" (No jumps between non-adjacent steps).  
* **"Prospect's Why" Requirement:** For a prospect to move to the "Qualified" stage, the "Prospect's Why" field must be filled. If it's not, the transition is rejected, and the user receives feedback.  
* **Automated Follow-up Task Creation:** The first time a prospect transitions to "Presentation Sent," the system automatically creates a follow-up task (due approximately 24-48 hours later) if one doesn't already exist for that prospect.
