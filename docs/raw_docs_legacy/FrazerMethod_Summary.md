This document outlines a 5-day recruiting challenge designed to develop a consistent daily action mindset in participants, drawing from Frazer Brookes's methods. The challenge provides an end-to-end system for recruiting new business partners, from lead generation to integration, with the goal of instilling essential skills and habits for business expansion.

The program is built on several core components:

* **Daily Method of Operation (DMO):** Emphasizes consistent daily activities including talking to people, inviting them to learn more, showing them the opportunity, and consistent follow-up.  
* **Self-Leadership and Time Management:** Stresses the importance of personal accountability, discipline, and strategic time blocking for effective implementation.  
* **Prospecting System ("Who," "Where," "What"):** Guides participants in defining their ideal prospect, identifying where to find them, and creating an action plan for meaningful engagement.  
* **Four Types of Conversations & Ping-Pong Method:** Focuses on fostering genuine connections and maintaining dynamic dialogue with prospects.  
* **Three-Question Funnel:** A qualification tool to assess prospect seriousness, motivation, and potential by delving into their desires, challenges, and openness to solutions.  
* **Presentation Phase:** Addresses prospect questions and hesitations by explaining the role, reassuring their capabilities, and demonstrating the value and benefits of the opportunity.  
* **Follow-Up:** Highlighted as "the most profitable stage," advocating for a minimum of seven distinct, value-adding interactions to build trust and guide decisions.  
* **SAGA Framework (Sales, Activity, Goals, Affirmations):** A structured approach for launching new partners successfully, focusing on early wins, consistent activities, clear goals, and cultivating a positive mindset.

Beyond these components, the document addresses critical operational aspects:

* **Requirements:** Outlines necessary tools, resources, and commitment levels.  
* **Decisions:** Highlights strategic choices participants need to make early on, such as defining their niche and unique selling proposition.  
* **Open Questions:** Identifies areas needing further clarification or personalization, like specific business opportunity details and detailed prospect demographics.  
* **Risks:** Acknowledges potential pitfalls, primarily "lack of consistent activity," and other risks like burnout or inadequate support.

Finally, the document provides detailed, actionable tasks with clear descriptions and measurable acceptance criteria for each stage, ensuring a practical, results-oriented program for expanding a business partner network.

  \- Source: \[1\] "2. The Three-Question Funnel This is a system for moving people from a "yes" to a "why." It helps you qualify prospects and ensures you're spending time with those who are truly serious."  
\- REQ-013: The presentation must answer three core questions for the prospect: "What do I actually do?", "Can I do it?", and "Will it be worth it?".  
  \- Rationale: To provide clarity and enable an informed decision.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "The three questions a prospect needs to answer for themselves are: 1\. "What do I actually do?": The presentation must clearly and concisely explain the system or process they would be following. 2\.

This can be done by sharing simple, relatable steps and showing that people just like them are already succeeding. 3\. "Will it be worth it?": The presentation must clearly connect the effort they put in with a potential return, whether that's financial, personal, or a solution to a problem they've expressed."

\- REQ-011: The system must provide a method for transitioning from casual conversation to business presentation.  
  \- Rationale: To effectively qualify prospects and save time/energy.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "NUMBER THREE: Based on the third video, here's a system to implement Frazer Brookes's teaching on moving from casual conversation to a business presentation. This phase is about transitioning and qualifying prospects effectively to save time and energy."  
\- REQ-012: A "Three-Question Funnel" must be used to qualify serious prospects.  
  \- Rationale: To move people from "yes" to "why" and protect time from curious individuals.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "2. The Three-Question Funnel This is a system for moving people from a "yes" to a "why." It helps you qualify prospects and ensures you're spending time with those who are truly serious."  
\- REQ-013: The presentation must answer three core questions for the prospect: "What do I actually do?", "Can I do it?", and "Will it be worth it?".  
  \- Rationale: To provide clarity and enable an informed decision.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "The three questions a prospect needs to answer for themselves are: 1\. "What do I actually do?": The presentation must clearly and concisely explain the system or process they would be following. 2\. "Can I do it?": The presentation should build belief in their own ability to succeed. This can be done by sharing simple, relatable steps and showing that people just like them are already succeeding. 3\. "Will it be worth it?": The presentation must clearly connect the effort they put in with a potential return, whether that's financial, personal, or a solution to a problem they've expressed."  
\- REQ-014: The system must incorporate effective follow-up strategies.  
  \- Rationale: "The fortune is in the follow-ups" and most people join after the presentation.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "The fifth video, which concludes the five-day recruiting challenge, focuses on the final and most profitable stage of the recruiting pipeline: The Follow-Up and Launch. The central theme is: "The fortune is in the follow-ups." The video emphasizes that most people join after the presentation, and the follow-up process is crucial for converting prospects into partners."  
\- REQ-015: A "SAGA" framework (Sales, Activity, Goals, Affirmations) must be used for launching new partners.  
  \- Rationale: To ensure new recruits immediately succeed.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "Launch Plan: The "SAGA" Framework (Sales, Activity, Goals, Affirmations)"

Constraints & Assumptions:

  \- Status: accepted  
  \- Rationale: Explicitly stated in the document as the basis for the challenge.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "NUMBER ONE: Based on Frazer Brookes's recruiting plan, here's a comprehensive system you can implement to cover all the concepts he discussed."

Open Questions:  
\- Q-001: What specific business, product, or opportunity is being recruited for? (Not specified in document)  
\- Q-002: What are the specific demographics, pains, goals, and interests of the user's "aspirational self" for defining the ideal prospect? (Needs user input)  
\- Q-003: What are the specific online groups, public figures, or places the user will target for prospecting? (Needs user input)  
\- Q-004: What are the specific online tools (videos, websites, etc.) used for presentations? (Needs user input)  
\- Q-005: What are the specific compensation plans or value propositions to be communicated during presentations? (Not specified in document)

Risks:  
\- RISK-001: Lack of consistent daily activity could hinder progress.  
  \- Mitigations: Emphasize self-leadership, time management, and daily affirmations.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "The core principle is "Today's work creates tomorrow's results," emphasizing consistent daily action over sporadic effort."  
\- RISK-002: Fear of failure or success could prevent effective presentation and follow-up.  
  \- Mitigations: Adopt a mindset of serving others, problem-solving, and storytelling.  
  \- Source: \[1\] "Overcoming Internal Roadblocks Frazer stresses that the biggest challenges are often internal, including fear of failure or success. The solution is to take action despite these fears."
