**This document outlines a comprehensive prospect pipeline and activity tracking system for network marketing, designed for use in Google Sheets. It details a step-by-step flow for handling new contacts from initial connection to meeting booking and systematic follow-ups.**

The system includes:

* **Google Sheet Columns**: A list of 10 columns for tracking prospects, including Name, Contact Channel, Status, Relationship Level, Interest Level, Next Step, Last Contact Date, No-show?, Notes, and Priority (A/B/C).  
* **Prospect Flow (Step-by-Step)**: A seven-step process covering connecting and building rapport, sending videos as a fallback, follow-ups after video, webinar to 1:1 meetings, no-show handling, managing skeptical prospects, and qualification before dedicating time.  
* **System for Daily Use**: Instructions for sorting the Google Sheet by priority, working with A-priority prospects first, setting fixed follow-up times, and using conditional formatting for visual cues (e.g., red for no contact \>7 days, green for booked meetings, yellow for follow-up needed).  
* **Design Proposal for Google Sheets**: A detailed design for a "Network Marketing System" across four sheets:  
  * **Pipeline**: Table layout with design suggestions for headers, status column drop-downs with color coding, and conditional formatting for contact dates and priority.  
  * **Dashboard**: Suggestions for "tellerbokser" (counter boxes) using COUNTIF formulas for various lead statuses, and recommendations for bar and pie charts to visualize status and priority distribution.  
  * **90-dagers Tracker**: Table layout for daily tracking of invitations sent, follow-ups made, presentations booked/completed, new customers, and new partners, with design suggestions for headers, weekly background colors, and conditional formatting for invitation activity.  
  * **Team Leaderboard (Optional)**: A table for tracking team performance with design suggestions for highlighting top performers and using bar charts for weekly progress.

Key components include:

* **Prospect Pipeline:** A structured flow for handling new contacts, including stages like "Connect & Build rapport," "Video first (fallback)," "Follow up after video," and "Webinar \-\> 1:1." It also incorporates strategies for managing no-shows and skeptical prospects, and a qualification system to prioritize leads (A/B/C).  
* **Google Sheet Design:** Details 10 columns for tracking prospects (Name, Contact Channel, Status, Relationship Level, Interest Level, Next Step, Last Contact Date, No-show?, Notes, Priority) and suggests conditional formatting for visual cues (e.g., red for overdue contacts).  
* **System for Daily Use:** Instructions for prioritizing prospects, setting fixed follow-up times, and using visual indicators.  
* **Airtable-based Solution:** A comprehensive design with "Kundekort" (prospect card) for individual prospect details, a Dashboard for daily goals and alerts, a 90-day activity tracker, and an optional Team Leaderboard.  
* **Automation and AI Integration:** The system leverages Make (Integromat) for automation and the OpenAI API for AI functionalities. This includes AI-driven calculation of Relationship Level, Interest Level, and Priority based on notes, automated follow-up scheduling, and AI-generated message suggestions.  
* **Key Features:** Kanban-style pipeline visualization, gamification with progress bars, daily goal suggestions, win/loss analysis with AI insights, CSV lead import with AI mapping and auto-tagging, Google Calendar synchronization, and automated no-show follow-ups.  
* **User Experience:** Emphasizes a user-friendly interface with features like "Hent kundekort" (retrieve prospect card) and "Lag nytt kundekort" (create new prospect card) buttons, and a "ticker-style" alert system for important reminders and motivational quotes.  
* **Continuous Improvement:** Includes an "Improvements" function to capture user ideas and feedback for system refinement.  
* **IPA Focus:** Prioritizes Income Producing Activities (IPA) throughout the system, with AI coaching and weekly reviews to optimize focus on high-potential leads.  
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Designed to utilize the Make free tier and integrate OpenAI API with user approval for technical feasibility, aiming for low costs.

executive\_summary:  
  \- This document captures a conversation with ChatGPT regarding the development of a Network Marketing CRM system.  
  \- The user (Benjamin Semerci) wants a prospect-flow/pipeline schema to manage new contacts, including meeting booking, follow-ups, video fallback, and handling no-shows or skeptical prospects.  
  \- The user prefers working with Google Sheets initially, then transitions to Airtable for better automation and CRM-style features.  
  \- Key requirements include automated AI interpretation of notes for relation/interest scores, automatic follow-up scheduling, daily goals, gamification, and integration with Google Calendar.  
  \- The system should be user-friendly, highly automated, AI-driven, and cost-effective (preferably free or low-cost).  
  \- The conversation evolves to a comprehensive Airtable-based solution with Make (Integromat) for automation and OpenAI API (ChatGPT webhook) for AI functions.  
  \- Specific features include a "Kundekort" (prospect card) with AI-calculated scores, a Dashboard with daily goals and alerts, a 90-day tracker, and a Leaderboard (initially for the user only).  
  \- The system incorporates advanced follow-up logic for "dead leads" and no-shows, a "ticker-style" alert system, and AI-driven coaching.  
  \- The user emphasizes the importance of IPA (Income Producing Activity) as the core focus of the system.  
  \- The final plan outlines a full Airtable base with Prospects, Dashboard, and Improvements tables, integrated with Make for automation and OpenAI for AI features, with estimated low costs.
