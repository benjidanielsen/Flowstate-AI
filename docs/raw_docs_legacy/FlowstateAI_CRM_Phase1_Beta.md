\* How are prospect interactions (calls, emails, meetings) explicitly modeled and stored within the \`logs\` or a separate \`interactions\` entity?

\* \*\*State Management & Persistence:\*\*

\* Beyond \`localStorage\`, are there any plans for server-side persistence or a more robust client-side database (e.g., IndexedDB) to handle larger datasets and multi-device synchronization in future phases?

\* How is data integrity ensured when using \`localStorage\`, especially in scenarios of rapid updates or potential data corruption?

\* \*\*Frontend Framework & Modularity:\*\*

\* How are UI components designed to be truly reusable across different views (e.g., a generic modal component, a prospect card component)?

\* \*\*Performance & Scalability:\*\*

\* What are the current performance bottlenecks identified, especially regarding the \`x100 Process Walkthrough\`?

\* How will the system scale to handle thousands or tens of thousands of prospects without degrading performance, particularly for search, pipeline rendering, and dashboard updates?

## **FRAZER BROOKES METHOD / SYSTEM / PIPELINE**

**25 questions to help me better understand the Frazer Brookes method/system/pipeline, from a developer's standpoint, focusing on its integration and implications for the FlowState AI system:**

**Understanding the Core Frazer Brookes Method:**

1. What are the foundational principles or philosophies behind Frazer Brookes' recruitment flow that drive its effectiveness?  
2. Can you provide a more detailed breakdown of the "Relationship Building" stage within the Frazer pipeline? What specific actions or criteria define successful progression here?  
3. What are the key "qualifying questions" or criteria used in the "Qualified" stage to determine if a prospect is a good fit for a presentation?  
4. Beyond "What did you like best?", what other follow-up questions or strategies are recommended in the "Follow-up" stage to guide a prospect towards a decision?  
5. What does "continuation" specifically entail in the "Follow-up" stage, and how does it ensure a logical next step rather than a dead end?

**Integration & Implementation in FlowState AI:**

1. How will the "Prospect's Why" field be actively used by the NBA engine to generate more personalized and effective "Next Best Actions"?  
2. Can you elaborate on the "AI hint" mechanism within the NBA engine? What data points (beyond stage and tasks) will it consider to provide these hints?  
3. What specific "onboarding checklist" items are triggered when a prospect reaches the "Team Member" stage, and how will these be managed within FlowState AI?  
4. How will the system handle prospects who deviate from the linear Frazer pipeline flow (e.g., a "Team Member" who decides to revert to an earlier stage)?  
5. What are the acceptance criteria for successfully moving a prospect from one Frazer pipeline stage to the next within the FlowState AI system?

**Data & Analytics:**

1. What key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics will be tracked for each Frazer pipeline stage to measure its effectiveness and identify bottlenecks?  
2. How will data from the "Prospect's Why" field be aggregated and analyzed to identify common motivations or pain points among prospects?  
3. What kind of reporting and analytics will be available to users to understand their performance within the Frazer pipeline?  
4. How will the system differentiate between a prospect's "status" (Phase 1\) and their "stage" (Phase 2 Frazer pipeline) in the data model, and how will this be presented to the user?  
5. What data points are considered essential for the "Ticker" and "Goals" widgets on the dashboard to provide meaningful insights into user activity and progress?

**User Experience & Workflow:**

1. How will the "sticky topbar with Quick Search \+ Quick Note" be implemented to ensure it's always accessible without obstructing the main content?  
2. Can you provide more detail on the content and functionality of the "Info" tab within the prospect card? What "grundinfo" (basic info) will it display?  
3. What specific "AI-scripts" or "quick actions" are envisioned for the "Handlinger" (Actions) tab in the prospect card to assist users in moving prospects through the pipeline?  
4. How will the system provide clear visual feedback when a prospect successfully moves from one stage to another in the clickable progress bar?  
5. What mechanisms are in place to prevent user confusion when navigating between the NBA carousel on the dashboard and individual prospect cards?

**Technical Deep Dive (Frazer Specific):**

1. How is the  
   pipelineStages  
    array defined in the code directly mapped to the visual representation of the progress bar in the prospect card?  
2. What is the underlying logic for generating the  
   stageColors  
    gradient, and how is it ensured that these colors provide clear visual distinction and accessibility?  
3. How will the system handle the migration of existing Phase 1 "status" data to the new Phase 2 Frazer "stage" data, especially for prospects that are already in the system?  
4. What specific validation rules are applied to the "Prospect's Why" field beyond just being mandatory (e.g., minimum length, character types)?  
5. How is the  
   getNextBestAction()  
    function designed to be easily updated or extended as the Frazer method evolves or new best practices emerge?
