# Flowstate-AI Evolution Framework

**Version 1.0**

## Overview

The Flowstate-AI Evolution Framework is a comprehensive system designed to enable self-improvement, autonomous optimization, and continuous learning capabilities within the Flowstate-AI platform. It represents a paradigm shift from traditional software development to a model of continuous, self-directed evolution.

This framework allows Flowstate-AI to:

- **Monitor** its own performance and behavior
- **Identify** opportunities for improvement
- **Propose** and **validate** changes to its own code and configuration
- **Learn** from its experiences and store knowledge for future use
- **Operate** within safe, human-defined boundaries

## Core Components

The framework is composed of several key components that work together to achieve autonomous evolution:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Evolution Manager** | The core orchestrator of the evolution process. It manages the lifecycle of improvements, from identification to application. |
| **Metrics Collector** | Gathers and stores performance and behavior metrics from across the system, providing the raw data for analysis. |
| **Vector Knowledge Manager** | A persistent memory system that stores learned knowledge, code snippets, and successful strategies in a searchable vector database. |
| **Code Analyzer** | Statically analyzes code to assess quality, complexity, and maintainability, providing a basis for code improvement. |
| **Self-Modification Orchestrator** | Manages the process of autonomously modifying the system's own codebase. |
| **Anomaly Detector** | Monitors key metrics for unusual patterns or deviations from the norm, flagging potential issues. |
| **Evolution Governor** | Enforces human-defined policies and safety constraints, acting as a safeguard for the evolution process. |
| **Evolution Dashboard** | A user interface for monitoring the framework's activities, viewing key metrics, and providing human oversight. |

## How It Works

The Evolution Framework operates in a continuous cycle:

1.  **Observe**: The **Metrics Collector** gathers data on system performance, user interactions, and internal operations.
2.  **Analyze**: The **Anomaly Detector** and **Code Analyzer** process this data to identify potential issues or areas for improvement.
3.  **Propose**: The **Evolution Manager** uses this analysis, along with knowledge from the **Vector Knowledge Manager**, to generate and propose specific improvements.
4.  **Validate**: Proposed changes are tested in a sandboxed environment to ensure they are safe and effective.
5.  **Govern**: The **Evolution Governor** checks the proposed change against a set of rules and policies. If a change is high-risk, it may require human approval.
6.  **Apply**: Once validated and approved, the **Self-Modification Orchestrator** applies the change to the live system.
7.  **Learn**: The outcome of the change is monitored, and the results are fed back into the **Vector Knowledge Manager** to inform future evolutions.

This entire process is transparent and can be monitored in real-time via the **Evolution Dashboard**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A running instance of Flowstate-AI
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+

### Configuration

The Evolution Framework is configured via `python-worker/evolution_framework/config.py`. Key settings include:

- `evolution.enabled`: Toggle the entire framework on or off.
- `evolution.safe_mode`: If true, all proposed changes will require manual approval.
- `cost_threshold`: The maximum cost per operation before safe mode is triggered.

### Running the Framework

The Evolution Framework runs as part of the Python worker service. To start it, simply run the main Flowstate-AI application:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

## Operator Training

### Monitoring the System

- **Access the Dashboard**: The Evolution Dashboard is available at `/evolution` in the Flowstate-AI web interface.
- **Key Metrics to Watch**:
    - **Success Rate**: The percentage of applied improvements that resulted in a positive outcome.
    - **Anomaly Alerts**: Any detected anomalies will be flagged for review.
    - **Safe Mode Status**: Indicates whether the system is in a state of autonomous evolution or requires manual oversight.

### Human-in-the-Loop

While the system is designed for autonomy, human oversight is critical. The dashboard allows operators to:

- **Approve/Reject Changes**: Review and approve or reject high-risk changes proposed by the system.
- **Toggle Safe Mode**: Manually activate or deactivate safe mode if you observe unexpected behavior.
- **Search the Knowledge Base**: Query the system's learned knowledge to understand its reasoning.

## Safety and Governance

The **Evolution Governor** is the primary safety mechanism. It ensures that:

- No changes are applied that violate predefined rules.
- The system enters a safe state if significant anomalies are detected.
- High-impact changes (e.g., to security policies or database schemas) always require human review.

By default, the system operates in a balanced mode, but it can be configured for full autonomy or full manual control depending on your organization's needs.
