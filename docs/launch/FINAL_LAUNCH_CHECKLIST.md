# FlowState-AI Launch Readiness Checklist

This checklist is the last-mile control sheet for the "FlowState-AI GODMODE – Ultimate Autonomous AI Development System". It
folds the four historical plans, the nine-hour roadmap, and the operational diagrams into a single, enforceable set of actions.
Each block is timeboxed to **three hours** and must be claimed through `AUTONOMOUS_WORK_LOG.md` before execution.

---

## Phase 1 (Hours 0-3): Spin Up the GODMODE Brain

| # | Deliverable | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Brain Boot** | Architecture | `python ai-gods/project_manager_enhanced.py --health-check` passes and JSON logging is flowing to `godmode-logs/`. |
| 2 | **Knowledge Sync** | Collective Intelligence | `ai-gods/godmode_brain.py --show-plan` mirrors `collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json` and `collective-memory/project_status.json`. |
| 3 | **Rule Broadcast** | Program Management | `AUTONOMOUS_WORK_LOG.md` updated with owners + timestamps; announcement added to `docs/PHASE6_EXECUTION_BLUEPRINT.md`. |
| 4 | **Backup Sweep** | Operations | `archive/` contains all nonessential artefacts; root shows only active services, docs, and scripts. |

**Readiness Gates**
- Health checks green for project manager, demo seeding, and error-handling tests.
- GODMODE plan + checklist locations announced in team channels.
- Windows + Unix scripts verified from `scripts/` directories.
- Validation run documented via `docs/launch/SYSTEM_VALIDATION.md`.

## Phase 2 (Hours 3-6): Deploy the AI Build Army

| # | Deliverable | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Squad Rosters** | Project Manager AI | Roles/queues registered in `collective-memory/project_status.json` and mirrored in `AUTONOMOUS_WORK_LOG.md`. |
| 2 | **Feature Factories** | Backend/Frontend/Data Squads | Each squad executes one vertical slice (Pipeline, Reminder System, NBA Engine) with tests logged in `docs/operations/TEST_REPORT.md`. |
| 3 | **Observability Spine** | DevOps | Structured logging -> `godmode-logs/`; dashboards refreshed; retry/guard helpers covered by `tests/test_error_handling.py`. |
| 4 | **Continuous QA** | Quality Engineering | `python -m unittest discover -s tests` and `npm run test` (frontend/backend) pass; defects triaged into backlog. |

**Readiness Gates**
- Demo flow recorded (`ai-gods/project_manager_enhanced.py --demo`).
- CRM vertical diagrams mapped to backlog items (see below).
- Deployment playbooks updated with new automation triggers.

---

## Phase 3 (Hours 6-9): Pilot, Test, and Ship

| # | Deliverable | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Environment Hardening** | Site Reliability | Docker Compose booted, migrations run, `scripts/windows/START_FLOWSTATE_WINDOWS.bat` validated via dry run or equivalent PowerShell. |
| 2 | **Operator Onboarding** | Enablement | Five pilot packets created (`docs/windows/` references + tailored credentials). Feedback template stored in `collective-memory/`. |
| 3 | **Acceptance Window** | Program Management | Three-hour guided test executed; pass/fail logged in `docs/operations/SYSTEM_STATUS_REPORT.md`. |
| 4 | **Launch Sign-off** | Executive Sponsor | Go/No-Go recorded with mitigation notes; `collective-memory/project_status.json` advanced to `phase_3_launch_complete`. |

**Readiness Gates**
- Monitoring hooks in `godmode-tools/system-status.py` reporting green.
- Emergency procedure validated (`safety-nets/emergency-recovery.py`).
- Release retro + backlog follow-ups captured in `docs/operations/`.

## CRM Build Sequence Reference (for Squads)

1. **Lead Intake → Qualification**
   - Capture source (referral, website form, campaign) and pipeline stage updates.
   - Score intent frequency, engagement, and outcome probabilities.
2. **Reminder + Escalation Engine**
   - Automate follow-up scheduling, no-show detection, and calendar sync.
   - Tie automation triggers to NBA generation.
3. **Next Best Action (NBA) Loop**
   - Use scoring components to recommend automation vs manual outreach.
   - Feed decisions into event logging for future learning.
4. **AI Learning Loop**
   - Capture telemetry, self-evaluations, and refinements for autonomous squads.

## Guardrails & Rules of Engagement

1. **Claim → Execute → Log** — No silent work. Every action logged in the command board with artefact links.
2. **Health First** — Before writing code, run `scripts/unix/FULL_SYSTEM_CHECK.sh`
   (or the Windows PowerShell equivalent) or, at minimum,
   `python -m compileall ai-gods/*.py` and `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
3. **Docs Stay Current** — Update `docs/godmode/` and `docs/operations/` immediately when designs or runbooks change.
4. **Backups Stay in `archive/`** — Only active assets in root; anything legacy or bulk goes under `archive/`.
5. **Status Ledger is Source of Truth** — Use `ai-gods/godmode_brain.py --set-phase <phase>` to progress milestones.
