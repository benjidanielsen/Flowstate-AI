# FlowState-AI GODMODE Brain Roadmap

The GODMODE Brain is the canonical launch sequence for the "FlowState-AI GODMODE
- Ultimate Autonomous AI Development System". It merges the insights from every
prior planning artefact into a three-phase, nine-hour playbook so new
contributors can see what happens first, last, and how to execute without guess
work.

## 1. Source Intelligence

The roadmap consolidates the four primary GODMODE knowledge bases:

| Document | Contribution |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/godmode/GODMODE_AI_AGENT_PLAN.md` | Original mission framing and desired autonomous behaviours. |
| `docs/godmode/GODMODE_AI_AGENT_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION_V2.md` | Canonical system architecture, service responsibilities, and data flows. |
| `docs/godmode/GODMODE_AI_AGENT_ENHANCEMENTS_DOCUMENTATION.md` | Latest enhancements to the project manager, communication hub, and autonomous development loops. |
| `docs/godmode/AI_AGENT_ECOSYSTEM_ANALYSIS_V2.md` | Ecosystem survey that enumerates the supporting agents, integrations, and operational environment. |

Legacy Manus MACCS mechanisms are preserved as principles rather than code: we
retain asynchronous messaging, durable decision logs, and agent expertise
routing, but the Manus files themselves have been removed to eliminate noise.

## 2. Three-Phase, Nine-Hour Launch Sequence

Each phase is timeboxed to three hours. Agents and humans claim work through the
shared command board (`AUTONOMOUS_WORK_LOG.md`) and synchronise progress via the
status ledger (`collective-memory/project_status.json`).

### Phase 1 – Assemble the GODMODE Brain (Hours 0-3)
* Wire the enhanced Project Manager AI, communication hub, and resilience
  tooling under the shared configuration loader.
* Capture Manus lessons into the collective memory patterns.
* Publish the roadmap everywhere: docs, JSON plan, and the live task board.

### Phase 2 – Mobilise the AI Build Army (Hours 3-6)
* Instantiate specialised squads (backend, frontend, automation, data) with
  crisp acceptance criteria.
* Automate continuous build, review, and regression guards using the enhanced
  tooling.
* Run vertical CRM demos, capture telemetry, and funnel defects back into the
  autonomous backlog.

### Phase 3 – Stage the Live Pilot (Hours 6-9)
* Harden staging/production pipelines, secrets, and health automation.
* Onboard the five human operators with access packets and quick-start guides.
* Execute the acceptance window, log results, and capture go/no-go decisions.

## 3. Command Board & Status Feeds

* **Roadmap JSON:** `collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json` is the machine-
  readable source of truth for the phases, steps, owners, and deliverables.
* **Status Ledger:** `collective-memory/project_status.json` tracks current
  phase, completion state, and upcoming milestone timestamp.
* **Work Log:** `AUTONOMOUS_WORK_LOG.md` hosts the mandatory claim/complete task
  board with direct links to the roadmap and execution blueprint.

## 4. Execution Blueprint

`docs/PHASE6_EXECUTION_BLUEPRINT.md` now describes how the GODMODE Brain executes
each phase. Despite the legacy filename, it acts as the operational runbook for
this plan until new dashboards ship. Follow it for prerequisites, validation
steps, and reporting expectations.

## 5. Operating Rules

1. **Claim Before Work:** No task begins until an owner signs the work log.
2. **Log Outcomes:** Every deliverable includes references to commits, logs, or
   artefacts in the Notes column.
3. **Keep the Brain Updated:** Use `python ai-gods/godmode_brain.py --set-phase
   <phase>` to advance the status ledger when phases change.
4. **Preserve Institutional Memory:** Summaries, design decisions, and pilot
   feedback go into `collective-memory/` so future operators inherit the context.

## 6. Transition Notes

* Manus-era files have been removed from the repository. Their best ideas live
  on through the principles above and the command board workflow.
* The GODMODE Brain orchestrator (`ai-gods/godmode_brain.py`) is the single
  automation entrypoint for the roadmap. It keeps the plan and status files in
  sync so autonomous agents can load and execute the sequence immediately.
