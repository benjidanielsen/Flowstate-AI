# UX/UI Audit for Web App Design Improvements

This Manus share link details a task involving a UX/UI audit for web application design improvements. The key aspects of this task include:

- **Scope Definition**: Determining the scope and target of the UX/UI audit.
- **User Requirements**: Clarifying specific aspects of UX/UI design (e.g., mobile responsiveness, accessibility, enterprise vs. consumer applications) and industry-specific requirements.
- **Process**: Manus requested a specific website URL to conduct the audit, perform a comprehensive evaluation of accessibility, usability, and design consistency, and then create a detailed report with improvement recommendations.

This replay highlights the importance of user experience and interface design for web applications. For the Flowstate-AI project, this suggests that the frontend (dashboard) should be intuitive, user-friendly, and well-designed to facilitate hands-free operation and effective interaction with AI agents. The ability to conduct UX/UI audits could be a valuable capability for the AI agents themselves, ensuring continuous improvement of the system's usability.
