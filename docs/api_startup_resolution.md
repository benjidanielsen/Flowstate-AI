# FastAPI API Startup Issue Resolution

## Issue Description

The FastAPI application located at `Flowstate-AI/python-worker/src/main.py` failed to start with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ai_gods'`.

## Root Cause

The `main.py` file imports `setup_logging` from `ai_gods.logging_config`. However, the `ai_gods` directory was not directly discoverable by the Python interpreter when running the `main.py` script from the project root. This typically happens when a module is part of a larger package structure and Python's import mechanism cannot locate it without the parent directory being in the `PYTHONPATH`.

## Resolution

The issue was resolved by adding the `Flowstate-AI` project root directory to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable before executing the FastAPI application. This allowed the Python interpreter to correctly locate the `ai_gods` package and its submodules.

**Steps to resolve:**
1. Activate the Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source Flowstate-AI/.venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Export the `PYTHONPATH` to include the project root:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/Flowstate-AI
   ```
3. Start the FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   python Flowstate-AI/python-worker/src/main.py
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix, the FastAPI application started successfully, and a `curl` request to the `/health` endpoint returned a healthy status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"<current_timestamp>"}
```

This confirms that the FastAPI API is now starting correctly and is accessible.
