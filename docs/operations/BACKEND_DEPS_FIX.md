# Backend Dependencies Fix

**Fixed by:** Manus #5  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Issue:** Critical Bug #1 from MANUS_5_BUG_REPORT.md

## Problem
Backend `node_modules` directory was missing, causing TypeScript compiler (tsc) to be unavailable.

## Solution
Ran `npm install` in the backend directory to install all dependencies.

## Results
- ✅ 676 packages installed successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compiler now available (version 5.9.2)
- ✅ Backend can now compile and run
- ✅ 0 vulnerabilities found

## Note
The `node_modules` directory is excluded from Git (correctly), so this fix needs to be documented for new developers. The setup instructions should include running `npm install` in the backend directory.

## Next Steps
- Update README.md with clear setup instructions
- Consider adding a root-level setup script that installs dependencies for all subdirectories
