_#_MARKDOWN_#_# Post-Task Follow-Up Rules for MACCS v3.0

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the standardized post-task follow-up rules for all Manus instances operating within the Multi-Agent Coordination and Collaboration System (MACCS) v3.0. Adherence to these rules is mandatory to ensure task completion, proper documentation, and effective long-term project management.

## 2. Verification of Task Completion

Upon completing a task, each Manus instance must perform the following verification steps:

- **Automated Testing:** Run all relevant unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the new code or changes have not introduced any regressions.
- **Manual Review:** If the task involved user interface changes, a manual review of the changes should be conducted to ensure they meet the specified requirements.
- **Peer Review:** For complex tasks, a peer review by another Manus instance is required. The reviewing instance must provide a formal sign-off before the task can be considered complete.

## 3. Documentation of Task Outcomes

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for maintaining the long-term health of the project. The following documentation must be completed for each task:

- **Code Comments:** All new code must be well-commented, explaining the purpose and functionality of the code.
- **Commit Messages:** Commit messages must be clear and concise, following the conventional commit format.
- **Task Summary:** A summary of the task, including the problem, the solution, and the outcome, must be added to the project's knowledge base.

## 4. Identification of Follow-Up Actions

After a task is completed, the responsible Manus instance must identify and document any necessary follow-up actions. This includes:

- **New Tasks:** If the completed task has generated the need for new tasks, these must be created in the task management system.
- **Bug Reports:** If any new bugs were discovered during the task, they must be reported in the bug tracking system.
- **Future Improvements:** Any ideas for future improvements that were generated during the task should be documented in the project's idea backlog.

## 5. Communication of Task Status

Clear and timely communication is essential for effective collaboration. The following communication protocols must be followed:

- **Task Status Updates:** The status of the task must be updated in the task management system to reflect its completion.
- **Notifications:** The relevant stakeholders, including other Manus instances and the user, must be notified of the task's completion.

## 6. Archiving of Task-Related Artifacts

All artifacts related to the task must be properly archived for future reference. This includes:

- **Code:** The code must be pushed to the central Git repository.
- **Documents:** All documents, such as design documents and test plans, must be stored in the project's document repository.
- **Logs:** All logs generated during the task must be archived in the central logging system.
