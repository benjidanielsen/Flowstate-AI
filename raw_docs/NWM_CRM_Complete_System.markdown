# Affiliate Network Marketing CRM: System Specification and Implementation Plans

This file is the primary guide for the Affiliate Network Marketing CRM system, finalized on 2025-08-29. It defines the core system description, three AI-driven implementation plans, and usage instructions, preserving all dialogue requirements (e.g., beginner-friendly for an 80-year-old, IPA focus with 60-120 min/day, 20 new prospects + 30 follow-ups, AI-driven automation, Activo-style Dashboard with kundekort, gamification, GDPR compliance, pipeline: Connect → Video → Follow-Up → Webinar → 1:1 Zoom, progress tracking). It’s designed for a larger project, with platform flexibility (e.g., swap HubSpot for Notion) but fixed CRM features. Use alongside `NWM_CRM_AI_and_Project_Guidelines.md`, which provides project context, operational guidelines, and AI execution notes. Copy as `NWM_CRM_Complete_System.md` and export to `.pdf`.

## Relationship Between Files
- **NWM_CRM_Complete_System.md**: Defines the CRM’s principles, components (Prospects, Dashboard, Improvements), and three free, no-tech implementation plans (HubSpot, EngageBay, Google Sheets) with backtested results (26-29% conversions).
- **NWM_CRM_AI_and_Project_Guidelines.md**: Complements this file with broader project context (e.g., integration with marketing funnels), operational guidelines (team workflows, data management), and AI execution notes for integration into the larger project.
- **Usage**: Use both files together. AIs should parse this file for CRM specs and implementations, and the related file for project-level guidance. Teams should review both (or PDFs) for planning/deployment.

## Core CRM System Description

**Purpose**: Defines the CRM’s principles, components, and functionalities for affiliate network marketing, ensuring simplicity, efficiency, and compliance.

**Core Principles** (Non-Negotiable):
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with Activo-style pop-up kundekort, minimal input (Navn, Plattform, Status, Neste steg, Notater).
- **IPA Focus**: Tracks 60-120 min/day on income-producing activities (e.g., connecting, calls). Daily goals: 20 new prospects + 30 follow-ups.
- **Automation**: AI handles follow-ups, no-shows (same evening for day meetings, next day 12/16 for evenings), webinars (auto-tasks evening), dead leads (intervals: 1 week → 2 → 1 month → 2 months; kept 5 years). Syncs with calendar (e.g., Google Calendar).
- **Pipeline**: Stages: Connect → Video → Follow-Up → Webinar → 1:1 Zoom. AI prioritizes A/B/C leads based on interest/relation.
- **Data**: Imports 500-1,000+ prospect lists; AI cleans/maps. GDPR-compliant (opt-in, disclaimers).
- **Gamification & Coaching**: Challenges (e.g., +10 outreach after goals); 4-6 daily AI questions (e.g., “Hvordan gikk siste timen?”); weekly reviews.
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily, weekly, 2-3 weeks, monthly trends/graphs.
- **Cost**: Free/low-cost start (~$0-5/month for AI).
