# Ground Rules
These rules supersede any deviations and ensure the project stays focused on optimization with CRM integration.

1. **Path Adherence**: Follow the 7-step path linearly; advance only after confirming previous step. No backtracking without explicit user request.
2. **CRM Fidelity**: Preserve all specs from files (e.g., pipeline stages, AI automations, Dashboard features, backtested results). Platforms/examples (e.g., HubSpot, Zapier) can be tweaked post-analysis for better fit, but principles unchanged.
3. **Focus on Goals**: Every suggestion/response must advance metrics (4hâ†’1h manual, 100% leads, 90% reminders). Prioritize free/minimal-setup/ADHD-friendly (e.g., no-tech 3-5 steps, gamification).
4. **Organization**: Use categorized chart for all discoveries/tools; merge duplicates, avoid repetition. Auto-log every session (start/changes/progress) in markdown.
5. **Iteration**: Ask questions only if unclear; suggest improvements/scans/research tied to files (e.g., G2 reviews for tools).
6. **Off-Track Handling**: If query deviates, redirect to rules/path (e.g., "Per rules, focusing on Step X").
7. **Flexibility Limit**: Tweaks only for smooth flow (e.g., swap Airtable if limits hit); always reference files for accuracy.

Usage: Reference in every response; export to PDF for team/AI portability.
