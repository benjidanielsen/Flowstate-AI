# Project Structure
The project contains 5 core components (minimal to avoid complexity), integrated via no-code (e.g., Zapier free). All must align with CRM module and optimization goals.

1. **CRM Module (1 component)**: Core prospect management (from files: Prospects/Dashboard/Improvements tables, AI automations). Integrates with all others (e.g., feed leads to social).
2. **Task Optimization Suite (1 component)**: Tools for content/social/tracking/files (e.g., ChatGPT + Canva + Buffer + OneDrive, all-in-one via Notion/HubSpot dashboard).
3. **Automation Layer (1 component)**: Connectors for flow (e.g., Zapier/Make for reminders/follow-ups/no-shows syncing to calendar).
4. **Logging/Self-Improving System (1 component)**: Hybrid log (text + AI suggestions); stores in markdown, uploadable.
5. **Metrics/Testing Dashboard (1 component)**: Tracks goals (e.g., time/lead/stress metrics); uses CRM reports/graphs.

Containment Rules:
- Total components: Exactly 5; no additions without merging.
- Integrations: Free/no-code only (e.g., API/sync via files' notes); cross-platform (Windows/iPhone/online).
- Scalability: Start solo (1-15 users), expand to 1,000+ contacts per files.
- Files: Contain all in /project/ folder (docs for MDs/PDFs, tools for setups).

Usage: Build one component per step; ensure CRM feeds data to suite (e.g., prospect scores to analytics).
