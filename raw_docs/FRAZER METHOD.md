HERE IS A DESCRIPTION WITH **4 OUT OF 5** SUMMARIZES:

**\=SUMMARIZES STARTING HERE=**  
Here is a comprehensive summary of the key systems and principles from the four videos you provided, structured as a complete, actionable recruiting plan.  
---

### **1\. The Foundation: Mindset and Daily Activity**

The core of this recruiting system is built on the principle of **"Today's work creates tomorrow's results."** Your success depends on consistent, daily action and a powerful mindset.

* **Daily Method of Operation (DMO):** Follow these four steps every day:  
  1. **Talk to People:** Start friendly, genuine conversations.  
  2. **Invite Them:** Ask if they're open to learning what you do.  
  3. **Show Them:** Give a business presentation.  
  4. **Keep Talking to Them:** Follow up and maintain the relationship.  
* **Self-Leadership:** Manage your time by setting and protecting dedicated work blocks. Use affirmations to build an unstoppable mindset, such as: "Consistency compounds," "I am a problem solver, not a sleazy car salesman," and "When I share, I serve."  
* **Measure Progress by Activity:** Focus on the number of conversations started and connections made, not just on immediate results.

### **2\. The Prospecting System: Who, Where, What**

This system helps you efficiently find and engage with your ideal prospects.

* **The "Who":** Define your ideal prospect by identifying their values, age, marital status, goals, pains, and interests. The goal is to find people who are like you.  
* **The "Where":** Find your "Who" in three key places:  
  * **Groups:** Join online groups related to their interests or pains.  
  * **Comments:** Engage with the posts of influencers and public figures who have an audience that matches your ideal prospect.  
  * **Places:** Use location-based searches on social media to find and connect with people in specific areas.  
* **The "What":** Your daily action plan should include:  
  * Writing down your "who."  
  * Finding and following 10 new people who fit your profile.  
  * Engaging with 5 of them personally.

---

### **3\. Conversation Flow: From Chat to Presentation**

Move conversations from small talk to a business opportunity using these targeted strategies.

* **The "Ping-Pong" Method:** Keep conversations natural and flowing. Engage in a series of back-and-forth messages (3-5 pings and pongs) to build genuine rapport.  
* **Transition Questions:** Use powerful, open-ended questions to transition to the business opportunity. The goal is to get the prospect to say "yes." Examples include:  
  1. "Do you keep your options open to earning extra income?"  
  2. "I was thinking about you the other day because \[reason\], would you be open to hearing about a solution?"  
* **The Three-Question Funnel:** If a prospect says "yes" to seeing the information, immediately ask these three questions to qualify them and save your time:  
  1. **"Why?"**: Ask why they are open to seeing the information.  
  2. **"What?"**: Ask them what they would need to see in a presentation to make a decision.  
  3. **"When?"**: Set a time and date for the presentation.

---

### **4\. The Presentation System: Clarity and Connection**

Your presentation should not be a data dump. It should be a clear, simple, and purposeful experience that addresses a prospect's core questions.

* **The Three Core Questions**: Your presentation must answer these questions for the prospect:  
  1. **What do I actually do?** (Explain the system or process.)  
  2. **Can I do it?** (Build belief with simple steps and relatable stories.)  
  3. **Will it be worth it?** (Connect their effort to a clear, tangible reward.)  
* **Presentation Methods**: Use one of these three methods to present the information:  
  1. **Online Tool**: Direct the prospect to a professionally made video or website.  
  2. **One-on-One**: Share the information personally on a video call or in person.  
  3. **Third-Party Tool**: Leverage a team meeting, live event, or webinar for social proof.  
* **The Power of Storytelling**: Share your personal story, or a story from someone on your team, that a prospect can relate to. This is essential because **people join people, not products.**  
* **Follow-up for a Decision**: After the presentation, your job is to guide the prospect to a clear decision, not to leave them in limbo. Ask questions that prompt a "yes" or "no" and be prepared to move on if the answer is "no."

# **NUMBER ONE:**  **Based on Frazer Brookes's recruiting plan, here's a comprehensive system you can implement to cover all the concepts he discussed. The core principle is "Today's work creates tomorrow's results," emphasizing consistent daily action over sporadic effort.**

### **1\. Daily Method of Operation (DMO)**

Your DMO is a daily routine that systematically moves people through your recruiting pipeline. The goal is to perform these actions daily to ensure continuous progress.

* **Talk to People**: Initiate friendly, genuine conversations to build rapport. Don't immediately pitch your business. Focus on connecting with people and showing a real interest in their lives.  
* **Invite Them**: Once rapport is established, ask if they are open to learning about what you do. This is a simple, low-pressure invitation, not a hard sell.  
* **Show Them**: Present your business, product, or opportunity. This can be a video, a live presentation, a website link, or a one-on-one conversation.  
* **Keep Talking to Them**: Follow up with them. A "no" today might be a "yes" tomorrow. Answer their questions and maintain the relationship, regardless of their decision.

### **2\. Self-Leadership and Time Management**

Successful implementation requires self-leadership, which means you are disciplined enough to manage your time and hold yourself accountable.

* **Set Your Time**: Schedule dedicated blocks of time in your calendar specifically for recruiting activities. Treat these appointments with yourself as non-negotiable.  
* **Protect Your Time**: During your scheduled recruiting time, eliminate distractions. This means turning off notifications, closing unnecessary browser tabs, and informing others not to interrupt you.  
* **Affirmations**: Use daily affirmations to reinforce your mindset. Frazer's examples include:  
  * "Consistency compounds."  
  * "Today's work creates tomorrow's results."  
  * "Through the mass comes the class."  
  * "I am in control of my activity, and my business grows because I grow."  
* **Progress Tracking**: Track your progress based on activity, not just results. Acknowledge and celebrate the number of new connections you make and conversations you start.

### **3\. Prospecting System: The "Who," "Where," and "What"**

This system helps you identify and engage with potential recruits effectively.

#### **Who: Defining Your Ideal Prospect**

This step is about creating a profile of the person you want to attract. Frazer suggests looking at yourself and identifying key attributes.

* **Values**: What are your core values (e.g., family, freedom, health)? Look for people who share these values.  
* **Gender and Age**: Define a general age range and gender profile.  
* **Marital Status and Kids**: Consider if you want to connect with people who are single, married, or have kids.  
* **Goals**: Identify the goals they might have, such as financial freedom, weight loss, or a new career.  
* **Pains**: What problems are they currently facing that your business or product can solve? (e.g., "tired of the 9-to-5 grind," "unhealthy lifestyle").  
* **Interests**: What are their hobbies or passions (e.g., fitness, cooking, travel)?

#### **Where: Finding Your "Who"**

This is where you actively search for people who fit your ideal prospect profile.

* **Groups**: Join online groups on platforms like Facebook that are related to your prospect's interests or pains. Look for groups that have active engagement.  
* **Comments on Public Figures' Posts**: Identify public figures or influencers who have an audience of people similar to your "who." Engage with their posts by leaving thoughtful comments.  
* **Places**: Use location-based searches on social media platforms like Instagram. Search for a specific city, gym, or cafe to find people in a certain area and start conversations.

#### **What: Your Daily Action Plan**

This is a specific, measurable plan for daily prospecting.

* **Write Your "Who"**: Spend 10-15 minutes defining your ideal prospect in detail. This ensures you're focused on the right people.  
* **Find 10 New People**: Using your "where" system, find 10 new people each day who fit your "who" profile and follow them. This consistently fills your pipeline.  
* **Engage with 5 of Them**: Engage with at least five of the new people you've found by leaving a thoughtful comment on a post, replying to a story, or sending a direct message. The goal is to start a conversation, not to sell.

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This complete system combines a simple, repeatable DMO with a strategic prospecting plan and a foundation of self-leadership. By focusing on consistent daily activity and genuinely connecting with people, you'll be able to build a robust recruiting pipeline over time.

# **NUMBER TWO:**  Based on the video provided, here is a breakdown of the key concepts and a comprehensive system for implementation, focusing on the principles of conversation and connection.

### **1\. The Core Recruiting Pipeline**

Frazer reiterates the core pipeline, which is the foundational system for all recruiting activities. This pipeline consists of several interconnected stages:

* **Lead Generation**: Identifying and finding potential recruits.  
* **Building Relationships**: Engaging in genuine conversations to establish trust and rapport.  
* **Asking the Question (ATQ)**: Moving the conversation toward the business opportunity by asking if they are open to learning more.  
* **Qualifying**: Determining if the person is a good fit for the business.  
* **Presentation**: Sharing the details of the business, product, or opportunity.  
* **Follow-up**: Continuing the conversation after the presentation to answer questions and address concerns.  
* **Closing**: Getting a final decision and helping them get started.  
* **Launching**: Setting up the new recruit for success.

The video's focus is on the "conversations" and "building relationships" part of this pipeline, emphasizing that a strong relationship is the foundation for everything that follows.

### **2\. The Four Types of Conversations**

Frazer outlines four distinct groups of people to engage with and provides specific strategies for each to ensure your conversations are effective and authentic.

#### **Group 1: People You Know But Have Never Spoken To**

This includes Facebook friends or Instagram followers with whom you've never had a direct conversation.

* **What to Say**: A simple, friendly message acknowledging your connection and expressing a desire to change that.  
  * *Example script*: "Hey \[Name\], I noticed we've been connected here for a while but have never spoken. Would love to change that\! How are you?"

#### **Group 2: People You Know But Haven't Spoken to in a While**

This group includes old friends or acquaintances with whom you have a lapsed connection.

* **What to Say**: Reconnect with a casual message to restart the dialogue.  
  * *Example script*: "Hey \[Name\], it's been a while\! How are things?" or "Hey \[Name\], I saw you went to \[place they posted about\]. How was that?"

#### **Group 3: People Who Follow You**

These are new followers who have shown interest in your content. They've essentially raised their hand by following you.

* **What to Say**: Acknowledge their follow and briefly state what you do, offering to help.  
  * *Example script*: "Hey \[Name\], great to be connected with you here. You may or may not know, but I help \[your ideal prospect\] to \[solve a problem or achieve a goal\]. Is there anything I can help you with?"

#### **Group 4: New People You Find (The "Who," "Where" system)**

This involves actively seeking out new prospects based on your ideal "who" profile.

* **What to Say**: Use a three-part message to start the conversation:  
  1. **Acknowledge them by name**: "Hey \[Name\]..."  
  2. **State how you found them**: "...I saw your post in the \[Group Name\] group and loved it."  
  3. **Ask a question**: "...\[Ask a question related to their post\]."

### **3\. The "Ping-Pong" Method for Building Relationships**

This method is a simple and effective way to sustain a conversation and build rapport without being awkward or salesy.

* **The Process**:  
  * You send a message (**Ping**).  
  * They reply (**Pong**).  
  * You reply back (**Ping**).  
  * They reply back (**Pong**).  
* **The Goal**: Engage in at least 3-5 back-and-forth messages before considering a transition to the business. The conversation should feel natural and flow easily. If it doesn't, it's a sign that they may not be the right fit, and it's time to move on to the next person.

### **4\. Overcoming Internal Roadblocks**

Frazer stresses that the biggest challenges are often internal, including fear of failure or success. The solution is to take action despite these fears.

* **Mindset**: Adopting the right mindset is crucial. Remember the core affirmations:  
  * "I am a problem solver, not a sleazy car salesman."  
  * "When I share, I serve; it is a disservice to stay silent."  
  * "I am magnetic; the right people are drawn to my energy."  
* **Just Press the Button**: The first message is the hardest part. The fear of "what if they say no?" is real, but the potential rewards of "what if they say yes?" are far greater.  
* **Being a Talent Scout**: View yourself as a talent scout looking for the right people, not a hunter chasing down prospects. This shifts your focus from selling to serving.

This system provides a structured, actionable plan for initiating and managing conversations to build a powerful recruiting pipeline. The emphasis is on consistency, authenticity, and a positive mindset to overcome the internal and external challenges of recruiting.
