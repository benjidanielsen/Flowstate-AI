# Flowstate-AI v2030: The Autonomous AI Operating System

![Flowstate-AI Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjidanielsen/Flowstate-AI/main/docs/logo.png)

## Overview

**Flowstate-AI v2030** is a sophisticated, self-evolving CRM-OS built on a modular, agent-based architecture. Designed for autonomous operation, it aims to revolutionize customer relationship management through intelligent automation, continuous learning, and inter-agent collaboration. This system is engineered to adapt, optimize, and grow independently, providing a truly intelligent operating system for your business needs.

## Key Features

-   **Multi-Agent Architecture**: A network of specialized AI agents working collaboratively to achieve complex goals.
-   **Autonomous Evolution**: The system is designed to self-modify and improve its own code and behavior over time.
-   **Collective Memory with Semantic Search**: Agents share a common knowledge base, powered by vector embeddings and semantic search for efficient information retrieval.
-   **Inter-Agent Communication**: A robust job queue system facilitates seamless and asynchronous communication between agents.
-   **Workflow Orchestration**: Advanced capabilities to define, execute, and manage complex multi-step workflows involving multiple agents.
-   **Supabase Integration**: Leverages Supabase for a scalable and real-time backend, including PostgreSQL for data storage, `pgvector` for embeddings, and more.
-   **Modular Design**: Built with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new agents, services, and integrations.

## System Architecture

Flowstate-AI v2030 comprises three main layers:

1.  **Supabase Database**: The persistent data layer, utilizing PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for vector embeddings, and managing `agent_states`, `documents`, and `job_queue` tables.
2.  **Backend (Node.js/TypeScript)**: An Express.js API server responsible for managing database operations, agent lifecycle, job processing, and memory services. It acts as the central hub for agent interactions with the database and external services.
3.  **Python Worker**: The execution environment for the AI agents, built with FastAPI. It hosts specialized agents, handles job execution, and facilitates inter-agent communication.

## Getting Started

To set up and run Flowstate-AI v2030, please refer to the comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` located in the project root directory. This guide provides detailed instructions for:

-   Prerequisites and environment setup
-   Database configuration (Supabase)
-   Backend and Python Worker installation
-   Running the test suite
-   API endpoints and usage examples
-   Troubleshooting common issues

## Project Status

The core architecture and foundational components are successfully implemented, including:

-   Supabase database schema with `pgvector` for vector embeddings.
-   Backend services for agent management, job processing, memory, and vector search.
-   Python worker with a base agent class and several specialized agents.
-   Inter-agent communication and workflow orchestration mechanisms.

Further development is ongoing to enhance agent capabilities, implement robust authentication, and build out a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline.
