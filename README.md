# Flowstate-AI

Flowstate-AI is an AI-first, self-improving CRM-OS for network marketers and solo founders. It enforces the Frazer Method with a strict pipeline, automates follow-ups, tracks no-show and inactivity, and surfaces Next Best Actions (NBA). Built with React/Tailwind + Node/TypeScript and a Python AI worker, it learns from logs to get smarter with each iteration.

## üöÄ GODMODE Brain Launch Sequence

The "FlowState-AI GODMODE - Ultimate Autonomous AI Development System" now
ships with a single source of truth for bringing the platform online:

- **Roadmap:** `docs/GODMODE_BRAIN_ROADMAP.md` distills the four historical
  GODMODE planning docs into a nine-hour, three-phase playbook.
- **Checklist:** `docs/launch/FINAL_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` turns the roadmap into
  claimable deliverables, readiness gates, and fast links for the launch team.
- **Automation:** `ai-gods/godmode_brain.py` keeps the roadmap JSON
  (`collective-memory/godmode_brain_plan.json`) and project status ledger in
  sync so autonomous agents or humans can execute the sequence instantly.
- **Validation:** `docs/launch/SYSTEM_VALIDATION.md` pairs with the
  one-command scripts in `scripts/unix` and `scripts/windows` to certify the
  stack before each launch milestone.
- **Command Board:** `AUTONOMOUS_WORK_LOG.md` contains the mandatory
  claim/complete task board. Update it before starting any task and include the
  deliverables once finished.

Advance phases or review progress with:

```bash
python ai-gods/godmode_brain.py --show-plan
python ai-gods/godmode_brain.py --set-phase phase_2_crm_delivery --mark-complete phase_1_ai_brain
```

This replaces the legacy Manus coordination stack; the best ideas from MACCS
now live inside the GODMODE Brain principles.
