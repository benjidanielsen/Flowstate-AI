## Progress Update: October 2, 2025 - Autonomous Session

### Prioritized Problem List from Proactive Problem Solver Report

Based on the `problem_report_20251002_030313.md` generated by the Proactive Problem Solver, the following issues have been prioritized for resolution:

#### Critical Severity Issues (Immediate Action Required)

1.  **Hardcoded Credentials in `README.md`**
    *   **Description**: `README.md` contains hardcoded GitHub tokens, posing a significant security risk.
    *   **Files**: `README.md` (Lines 79, 80)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Update the code to retrieve the value using `os.getenv()` or similar secure methods. Ensure the `.env` file is not committed to version control.

#### High Severity Issues (High Priority)

1.  **Outdated Dependencies in `package.json`**
    *   **Description**: Outdated dependencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.
    *   **Files**: `package.json` (Line 21)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Review `package.json` or `requirements.txt` for outdated dependencies. Use `npm outdated` (for Node.js) or `pip list --outdated` (for Python) to identify and update dependencies to their latest stable versions. Implement a dependency scanning tool for continuous monitoring.

2.  **Large Untested Files**
    *   **Description**: Several core Python files are large and lack obvious test files, making them prone to bugs and difficult to maintain.
    *   **Files**: 
        *   `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py` (757 lines)
        *   `manus_coordination_api_v2.py` (663 lines)
        *   `manus_client.py` (360 lines)
        *   `maccs_coordinator.py` (339 lines)
        *   `manus_dashboard.py` (260 lines)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Break down large files into smaller, more manageable modules or functions. Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all critical components. Implement code coverage tools to ensure adequate test coverage.

#### Medium Severity Issues (Standard Priority)

1.  **Unhandled Exceptions**
    *   **Description**: Instances of `try:` blocks without corresponding `except` blocks, indicating potential unhandled exceptions that could lead to crashes.
    *   **Files**: Numerous Python files (e.g., `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, `manus_client.py`, `maccs_coordinator.py`, `manus_dashboard.py`, `auto_github_backup.py`, `proactive_problem_solver.py`)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Implement robust `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle potential exceptions. Log errors for debugging and provide user-friendly feedback where appropriate. Consider using a centralized error logging system.

2.  **Inefficient Database Queries**
    *   **Description**: Potential for inefficient SQL queries (e.g., `SELECT *`, `LIKE` clauses without proper indexing) that could lead to performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Files**: `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, `manus_dashboard.py`
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Analyze database queries for performance bottlenecks. Consider adding appropriate database indexes, optimizing `WHERE` clauses, or refactoring queries to retrieve only necessary data. Use an ORM or query builder to construct efficient queries.

#### Low Severity Issues (To be addressed after higher priorities)

1.  **Missing Documentation**
    *   **Description**: Numerous functions and classes across various Python files lack docstrings, making the code harder to understand and maintain.
    *   **Files**: Many Python files (e.g., `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, `manus_client.py`, `maccs_coordinator.py`, `manus_dashboard.py`, `auto_github_backup.py`, `proactive_problem_solver.py`)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Add clear and concise docstrings to functions, classes, and modules. Ensure documentation explains purpose, arguments, return values, and side effects. Maintain a `README.md` for overall project documentation.

2.  **TODO Comments**
    *   **Description**: Various `TODO` comments indicate unfinished work or potential future issues.
    *   **Files**: Multiple files
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Review and address all `TODO` comments. Implement suggested changes, create new tasks, or remove comments if no longer relevant. Regularly clean up technical debt indicated by `TODO`s.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 2: Implement solutions for critical and high-severity problems identified in this prioritized list, starting with the hardcoded credentials in `README.md`.


## Progress Update: October 2, 2025 - Autonomous Session (Phase 2)

### Resolved Critical and High Severity Problems

1.  **Hardcoded Credentials in `README.md`**
    *   **Status**: Resolved
    *   **Description**: Removed hardcoded GitHub tokens from `README.md` and replaced them with instructions to use environment variables.
    *   **Impact**: Significantly improved security by eliminating direct exposure of sensitive credentials.

2.  **Outdated Dependencies in `backend` (Node.js)**
    *   **Status**: Resolved
    *   **Description**: Updated all outdated Node.js dependencies in the `backend` directory to their latest stable versions using `npm update`.
    *   **Impact**: Enhanced security, improved compatibility, and potentially boosted performance of the backend services.

3.  **Outdated Dependencies in `python-worker` (Python)**
    *   **Status**: Partially Resolved
    *   **Description**: Updated most outdated Python dependencies in the `python-worker` directory using `pip install --upgrade`. The `svglib` dependency, which relies on `pycairo`, could not be upgraded due to persistent build issues even after installing `build-essential` and `python3-dev`. This dependency is not critical for the current core functionality of the `python-worker`.
    *   **Impact**: Improved security and compatibility for most Python dependencies. The `svglib` issue will be noted for future investigation if its functionality becomes critical.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 3: Develop and implement comprehensive integration tests for core components, starting with the large, untested files identified in the problem report.
