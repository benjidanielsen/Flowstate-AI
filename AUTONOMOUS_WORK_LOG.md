## Progress Update: 02:44 UTC

### Completed Tasks
✅ **Automated GitHub Backup System** - Successfully implemented and running
- Created `auto_github_backup.py` script
- Configured to commit and push changes every 5 minutes
- Fixed GitHub token security issue (moved to environment variable)
- Successfully pushed first automated backup
- Process running in background (PID: 154451)

### Current Status
- Backup system is operational and will continue running every 5 minutes
- All Manus instances (#1, #2, #5) remain active and communicating
- Ready to proceed with next autonomous tasks

### Next Focus Areas
1. Create Manus Activity Monitoring Dashboard (CRITICAL priority)
2. Optimize MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE database performance
3. Enhance documentation for MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE

### Technical Notes
- Resolved git branch conflicts (switched from feature branch to main)
- Handled GitHub push protection for secrets
- Backup system now uses environment variables for credentials

## Progress Update: 02:48 UTC

### Completed Tasks
✅ **Manus Activity Monitoring Dashboard** - Successfully implemented and running
- Created Flask-based dashboard backend (`manus_dashboard.py`)
- Designed responsive HTML/CSS frontend with real-time updates
- Implemented comprehensive API endpoints for instances, tasks, performance, and health
- Dashboard accessible at http://localhost:3334
- Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- Process running in background (PID: 154812)

### Dashboard Features
The monitoring dashboard now provides comprehensive visibility into the autonomous system, displaying real-time information about all active Manus instances, their current tasks, progress percentages, performance metrics, and system health scores. The dashboard tracks tasks completed in the last twenty-four hours and shows the two longest tasks for each instance, enabling effective monitoring of autonomous operations.

### System Status
The automated GitHub backup system continues to operate successfully, committing and pushing changes every five minutes. All three Manus instances remain active and communicating through the MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE. The system health score currently stands at one hundred percent, indicating optimal operational status.

### Next Focus Areas
With the critical monitoring infrastructure now in place, the next priority involves optimizing the MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE database performance to reduce excessive query operations. Following that, comprehensive documentation will be created for the MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE to facilitate future development and maintenance.
