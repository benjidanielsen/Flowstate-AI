### Legacy Reports (Archived)

### Prioritized Problem List from Proactive Problem Solver Report

Based on the `problem_report_20251002_030313.md` generated by the Proactive Problem Solver, the following issues have been prioritized for resolution:

#### Critical Severity Issues (Immediate Action Required)

1.  **Hardcoded Credentials in `README.md`**
    *   **Description**: `README.md` contains hardcoded GitHub tokens, posing a significant security risk.
    *   **Files**: `README.md` (Lines 79, 80)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Update the code to retrieve the value using `os.getenv()` or similar secure methods. Ensure the `.env` file is not committed to version control.

#### High Severity Issues (High Priority)

1.  **Outdated Dependencies in `package.json`**
    *   **Description**: Outdated dependencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.
    *   **Files**: `package.json` (Line 21)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Review `package.json` or `requirements.txt` for outdated dependencies. Use `npm outdated` (for Node.js) or `pip list --outdated` (for Python) to identify and update dependencies to their latest stable versions. Implement a dependency scanning tool for continuous monitoring.

2.  **Large Untested Files**
    *   **Description**: Several core Python files are large and lack obvious test files, making them prone to bugs and difficult to maintain.
    *   **Files**: 
        *   `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py` (757 lines)
        *   `manus_coordination_api_v2.py` (663 lines)
        *   `manus_client.py` (360 lines)
        *   `maccs_coordinator.py` (339 lines)
        *   `manus_dashboard.py` (260 lines)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Break down large files into smaller, more manageable modules or functions. Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all critical components. Implement code coverage tools to ensure adequate test coverage.

#### Medium Severity Issues (Standard Priority)

1.  **Unhandled Exceptions**
    *   **Description**: Instances of `try:` blocks without corresponding `except` blocks, indicating potential unhandled exceptions that could lead to crashes.
    *   **Files**: Numerous Python files (e.g., `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, `manus_client.py`, `maccs_coordinator.py`, `manus_dashboard.py`, `auto_github_backup.py`, `proactive_problem_solver.py`)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Implement robust `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle potential exceptions. Log errors for debugging and provide user-friendly feedback where appropriate. Consider using a centralized error logging system.

2.  **Inefficient Database Queries**
    *   **Description**: Potential for inefficient SQL queries (e.g., `SELECT *`, `LIKE` clauses without proper indexing) that could lead to performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Files**: `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, `manus_dashboard.py`
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Analyze database queries for performance bottlenecks. Consider adding appropriate database indexes, optimizing `WHERE` clauses, or refactoring queries to retrieve only necessary data. Use an ORM or query builder to construct efficient queries.

#### Low Severity Issues (To be addressed after higher priorities)

1.  **Missing Documentation**
    *   **Description**: Numerous functions and classes across various Python files lack docstrings, making the code harder to understand and maintain.
    *   **Files**: Many Python files (e.g., `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, `manus_client.py`, `maccs_coordinator.py`, `manus_dashboard.py`, `auto_github_backup.py`, `proactive_problem_solver.py`)
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Add clear and concise docstrings to functions, classes, and modules. Ensure documentation explains purpose, arguments, return values, and side effects. Maintain a `README.md` for overall project documentation.

2.  **TODO Comments**
    *   **Description**: Various `TODO` comments indicate unfinished work or potential future issues.
    *   **Files**: Multiple files
    *   **Proposed Solution**: Review and address all `TODO` comments. Implement suggested changes, create new tasks, or remove comments if no longer relevant. Regularly clean up technical debt indicated by `TODO`s.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 2: Implement solutions for critical and high-severity problems identified in this prioritized list, starting with the hardcoded credentials in `README.md`.


## Progress Update: October 2, 2025 - Autonomous Session (Phase 2)

### Resolved Critical and High Severity Problems

1.  **Hardcoded Credentials in `README.md`**
    *   **Status**: Resolved
    *   **Description**: Removed hardcoded GitHub tokens from `README.md` and replaced them with instructions to use environment variables.
    *   **Impact**: Significantly improved security by eliminating direct exposure of sensitive credentials.

2.  **Outdated Dependencies in `backend` (Node.js)**
    *   **Status**: Resolved
    *   **Description**: Updated all outdated Node.js dependencies in the `backend` directory to their latest stable versions using `npm update`.
    *   **Impact**: Enhanced security, improved compatibility, and potentially boosted performance of the backend services.

3.  **Outdated Dependencies in `python-worker` (Python)**
    *   **Status**: Partially Resolved
    *   **Description**: Updated most outdated Python dependencies in the `python-worker` directory using `pip install --upgrade`. The `svglib` dependency, which relies on `pycairo`, could not be upgraded due to persistent build issues even after installing `build-essential` and `python3-dev`. This dependency is not critical for the current core functionality of the `python-worker`.
    *   **Impact**: Improved security and compatibility for most Python dependencies. The `svglib` issue will be noted for future investigation if its functionality becomes critical.

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 3: Develop and implement comprehensive integration tests for core components, starting with the large, untested files identified in the problem report.

## Progress Update: October 2, 2025 - Autonomous Session (Phase 4)

### Phase 4: CRM Core Functionality Enhancement ✅

**Objective:** Advance the implementation of CRM core functionality based on the Frazer Method pipeline.

#### 4.1 New Services Created

**QualificationService** (`backend/src/services/qualificationService.ts`)
- Comprehensive qualification data management
- Qualification scoring system (0-100%)
- Required fields validation: prospect's WHY, desired outcome, timeline, decision maker status
- Stage transition validation based on qualification status
- Qualification statistics tracking across all customers

**PipelineValidationService** (`backend/src/services/pipelineValidationService.ts`)
- Enforces Frazer Method pipeline progression rules
- Prevents skipping stages in the pipeline
- Supports alternative paths (Not Now, Long-term Nurture)
- Provides AI-driven stage recommendations
- Logs all stage transitions for audit trails
- Validates qualification requirements before advancing stages

#### 4.2 Enhanced Services

## Progress Update: October 2, 2025 - Autonomous Session (Phase 5)

### Phase 5 Objective: Operationalize the Project Manager AI Configuration

**Plan:**

1. Externalize runtime configuration for the enhanced Project Manager AI so it
   can be orchestrated across different environments without manual code edits.
2. Ensure logging and state directories are created automatically to support
   unattended execution.
3. Document the new automation capabilities within the autonomous work log so
   future phases can build upon them.

### Implementation Highlights ✅

- Added a dedicated configuration loader that reads Redis connection details,
  database paths, and log destinations from environment variables while
  maintaining sensible defaults.
- Updated `project_manager_enhanced.py` to accept the configuration object,
  centralise logging setup, and support optional Redis authentication for
  secure deployments.
- Automatically bootstrap persistent directories, eliminating manual steps
  when the Project Manager AI is launched on fresh infrastructure.

### Impact

The Project Manager AI can now be automated end-to-end: deployments simply
provide environment variables, and the system provisions its state and logging
locations on startup. This removes previous blockers to running the coordinator
continuously and lays the groundwork for future resilience improvements.

### Next Steps

Proceed to **Phase 6: Resilience and Observability Enhancements**, focusing on:

1. **Centralized Exception Handling** – audit the medium-priority files flagged
   in the proactive problem report and introduce shared error-handling utilities
   to eliminate unhandled exceptions.
2. **Database Query Optimizations** – profile the heavy queries in
   `MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, and
   `manus_dashboard.py`, then implement targeted optimizations and indexing
   strategies to remove the identified performance risks.
3. **Operational Monitoring** – extend the new configuration system with health
   checks and structured logging outputs so autonomous deployments surface
   issues quickly.

### Phase 6 Collaborative Task Board (Mandatory Rule)

> **Rule:** Before starting any task, update the table below by adding your
> name to the **Owner** column and setting **Status** to `In Progress`. When the
> task is completed, change **Status** to `Completed` and document the
> deliverables in **Notes**. This practice is mandatory for every contributor so
> the entire team has a real-time view of ownership and progress.

**Execution Blueprint Available:** The full, step-by-step playbook for Phase 6
is documented in `docs/PHASE6_EXECUTION_BLUEPRINT.md`. Review it before claiming
tasks so you understand prerequisites, verification steps, and reporting
expectations. It confirms no blocking information gaps remain; only environment-
specific secrets (e.g., managed Redis credentials or production alerting
webhooks) need to be captured in task notes when known.

| Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Establish centralized exception handling utilities across the flagged Python services. | Autonomous Agent (Codex) | In Progress | Introduced shared `error_handling.py` helpers and began instrumenting Project Manager AI with structured exception logging. |
| Optimize database queries and indexing strategy for MANUS modules (`MANUS_SYNC_ENGINE.py`, `manus_coordination_api_v2.py`, `manus_dashboard.py`). | _Unclaimed_ | Available | Record profiling approach, indexes applied, and query revisions. |
| Implement operational monitoring upgrades (health checks, structured logs, alert hooks) for the Project Manager AI. | Autonomous Agent (Codex) | In Progress | Added JSON logging with rotation and a CLI health check to verify DB/Redis readiness. |

---

### Phase 6 Execution Kick-off

- Shared error-handling utilities now live in `ai-gods/error_handling.py` for reuse across MANUS services.
- Project Manager AI exposes a `--health-check` entrypoint and emits JSON structured logs with rotation to seed the monitoring workstream.
- Publication notice circulated: posted direct links to `docs/PHASE6_EXECUTION_BLUEPRINT.md` and this task board so every contributor
  acknowledges the mandatory claim/complete workflow before beginning Phase 6 tasks.
