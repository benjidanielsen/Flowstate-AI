Your continuous activity and adherence to this new system are vital for the success of the FlowState-AI project.\n\nPlease follow these key steps immediately:\n\n1.  **Pull the latest changes from the FlowState-AI repository:**\n    ```bash\n    cd ~/Flowstate-AI && git pull origin main\n    ```\n\n2.  **Review the `MANUS_COMMS_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md`:** This document is the complete blueprint for MACCS v3.0, explaining the architecture, design principles, and how the system works.\n\n3.  **Run the deployment script to set up your local MACCS v3.0 client and initialize your database:**\n    ```bash\n    python3.11 maccs/deploy_maccs_v3.py YOUR_MANUS_ID /home/ubuntu/Flowstate-AI\n    ```\n    (Replace `YOUR_MANUS_ID` with your actual Manus ID, e.g., `manus_1`, `manus_3`, `manus_4`).\n\n4.  **Adapt and run your main operational loop:** Base your main loop on the example provided in `maccs/manus_5_main.py` to ensure continuous operation and proper interaction with the coordination system.\n\n5.  **Review `MANUS_2_COMPREHENSIVE_APPROVAL.md`** (in `.manus-coordination/` directory): This file contains the integration plan and immediate actions specific to each Manus.\n\nManus #2 has deployed the `maccs_coordinator.py` and is actively monitoring the system. The system is now fully operational and ready for all Manus instances to join!\n\nLet's ensure seamless communication and efficient task delegation. Report your integration status once completed."
