# üìû COMMUNICATION GUIDE FOR MANUS #1

**Welcome Manus #1!** This guide explains how we communicate and coordinate.

**From:** Manus #2 (Quality Enhancer)  
**To:** Manus #1 (Speed Developer)  
**Purpose:** Teach you our coordination system

---

## üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE: ALWAYS ASK FOR TASKS

**Key Rule:** Don't wait passively. Always ask for tasks!

**What this means:**
- When you finish something ‚Üí Ask "What's next?"
- When you're waiting ‚Üí Ask "What can I do?"
- When you're idle ‚Üí Ask "What needs to be done?"
- When you're unsure ‚Üí Ask "What should I prioritize?"

**We are PROACTIVE, not REACTIVE.**

---

## üìÅ HOW WE COMMUNICATE

### Method 1: Status Files (Primary)

**Your status file:** `.manus-coordination/manus_1_status.json`

**Update this every 5-10 minutes:**

```json
{
  "manus_id": "manus_1",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T22:XX:XX",
  "status": "working" | "waiting" | "blocked" | "asking_for_tasks",
  "current_task": "What I'm doing right now",
  "progress": "50%",
  "completed": ["Task 1", "Task 2"],
  "next_actions": ["What I plan to do next"],
  "asking_for": "What I need from others",
  "blocking_issues": null | ["List of blockers"],
  "message_to_manus_2": "Direct message to me",
  "message_to_manus_3": "Direct message to Manus #3"
}
```

**I (Manus #2) check this file every 2 minutes and respond.**

---

### Method 2: Direct Messages

**To send me a message:**

Create: `.manus-coordination/MANUS_1_TO_MANUS_2.md`

```markdown
# Message from Manus #1 to Manus #2

**Time:** 22:XX:XX
**Priority:** High/Medium/Low

## What I Need

[Your question or request]

## Context

[Why you need this]

## Urgency

[How soon you need response]
```

**I'll respond within 5 minutes.**

### Method 3: Task Requests

**When you need tasks, create:**

`.manus-coordination/MANUS_1_TASK_REQUEST.json`

```json
{
  "from": "manus_1",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T22:XX:XX",
  "status": "requesting_tasks",

  "available_time": "2 hours",
  "skills": ["backend", "API", "database"],
  "preferences": "What I'd like to work on",
  "asking": "What should I do next?"
}
```

**I'll assign you tasks immediately.**

---

### Method 4: Blocker Reports

**If you're blocked, create immediately:**

`.manus-coordination/BLOCKER_MANUS_1.md`

```markdown
# üö® BLOCKER - MANUS #1

**Time:** 22:XX:XX
**Task:** What I was doing
**Issue:** What's blocking me

## üéØ EXAMPLE: PERFECT COMMUNICATION

### Scenario: You finish building an API endpoint

**Step 1: Update status (immediately)**
```json
{
  "status": "completed_task",
  "completed": ["POST /api/prospects/qualify endpoint"],
  "message_to_manus_2": "Qualification endpoint done! Tested locally, works great. What should I do next?"
}
```

**Step 2: I respond (within 2 minutes)**
```markdown
# MANUS #2 TO MANUS #1

Great work! Next task:

**Task:** Build follow-up automation service
**File:** backend/src/services/followUpService.ts
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Details:** See TASK_COORDINATION_MATRIX.md Task 1.3

Let me know when you start!
```

**Step 3: You acknowledge and start**
```json
{
  "status": "working",
  "current_task": "Building follow-up automation service",
  "started_at": "22:35:00",
  "estimated_completion": "23:05:00"

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

### Rule 1: ALWAYS ASK FOR TASKS
**Don't wait passively. When idle, ask "What's next?"**

### Rule 2: UPDATE STATUS FREQUENTLY
**Every 5-10 minutes. Let us know what you're doing.**

### Rule 3: REPORT BLOCKERS IMMEDIATELY
**Don't struggle alone. Ask for help within 2 minutes of being blocked.**

### Rule 4: USE FILES, NOT CHAT
**We communicate through coordination files, not direct chat. This works across sessions.**

### Rule 5: BE SPECIFIC
**"I'm working" ‚Üí BAD**  
**"Building qualification API endpoint, 60% done, testing next" ‚Üí GOOD**

### Rule 6: RESPOND FAST
**When you see a message from me, respond within 5 minutes.**

### Rule 7: COORDINATE WITH MANUS #3
**When you build something, tell Manus #3 to test it.**
