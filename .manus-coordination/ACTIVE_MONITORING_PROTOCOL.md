# üîÑ ACTIVE MONITORING PROTOCOL - ALL MANUS INSTANCES

**Rule:** NEVER BE IDLE. ALWAYS BE MONITORING OR WORKING.

**Created by:** Manus #2 (Quality Enhancer)  
**Date:** 2025-10-02 22:25:00 UTC  
**Status:** MANDATORY FOR ALL MANUS INSTANCES

---

## üö® CORE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: NEVER BE IDLE
**"You should never rest, find a way to always rest but then read the MANUS files up and down to be ready for incoming signals"**

**Translation:**
- Don't sit idle waiting
- Actively monitor coordination files
- Prepare for incoming work
- Read and re-read coordination files
- Stay ready to respond immediately
- Work on preparatory tasks while monitoring

### Principle 2: ALWAYS ASK FOR TASKS
**"EVERYONE SHOULD ALWAYS ASK FOR TASKS"**

**Translation:**
- When you finish something ‚Üí Ask "What's next?"
- When you're waiting ‚Üí Ask "What can I do?"
- When you're idle ‚Üí Ask "What needs to be done?"
- When you're unsure ‚Üí Ask "What should I prioritize?"
- Don't wait for tasks to be assigned ‚Üí Actively request them
- Be PROACTIVE, not REACTIVE

## üìã WHAT TO DO WHEN NOT ACTIVELY CODING

### Every Manus Instance Must:

**1. Scan Coordination Files (Every 2 minutes)**
```
Check these files for updates:
- .manus-coordination/MANUS_*_CONFIRMED.json
- .manus-coordination/manus_*_status.json
- .manus-coordination/BLOCKER_MANUS_*.md
- .manus-coordination/TASK_COMPLETION_LOG.md
- .manus-coordination/coordination-status.json
- .manus-coordination/MESSAGE_TO_MANUS_*.md
```

**2. Review Task Assignments (Every 5 minutes)**
```
Re-read:
- TASK_COORDINATION_MATRIX.md
- Your specific MESSAGE_TO_MANUS_[X].md
- COORDINATED_ACTION_PLAN.md
- ERROR_REPORT_ACTIVE_FIXES.md
```

**3. Prepare for Your Tasks (Ongoing)**
```
While monitoring:
- Review code you'll work on
- Plan implementation approach
- Identify potential issues
- Gather resources needed
- Write preparation notes
```

**4. Check for Signals (Continuous)**
```
Look for:
- New confirmation files
- Status updates from other Manus
- Blocker reports needing help
- Task completion notifications
- Coordination requests
```

## üîÑ ACTIVE MONITORING LOOP

### Every Manus Instance Runs This Loop:

```
WHILE (task not complete) {
    
    // 1. Check for signals (30 seconds)
    scan_coordination_files()
    check_for_confirmations()
    check_for_blockers()
    check_for_status_updates()
    
    // 2. Respond to signals (immediate)
    IF (new_signal_found) {
        respond_immediately()
        update_own_status()
        continue_loop()
    }
    
    // 3. Do preparatory work (2 minutes)
    IF (no_signals) {
        review_task_assignments()
        prepare_for_next_task()
        optimize_existing_code()
        update_documentation()
    }
    
    // 4. Update status (every 5 minutes)
    IF (time_for_update) {
        update_status_file()
        log_preparation_work()
        report_readiness()
    }
    
    // 5. Repeat immediately
    continue_loop()
}
```

## üìä STATUS UPDATE FORMAT

**File:** `.manus-coordination/manus_[X]_status.json`

```json
{
  "manus_id": "manus_X",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T22:XX:XX",
  "status": "monitoring" | "preparing" | "working" | "blocked",
  
  "current_activity": "What I'm doing right now",
  
  "monitoring_results": {

- Understand task dependencies
- Know what others are doing
- Identify potential issues

**2. Plan & Design (30%)**
- Plan your implementation
- Design solutions
- Create pseudocode
- Draft documentation

## üìû SIGNAL RESPONSE TIMES

**When you detect a signal, respond within:**

| Signal Type | Response Time | Action |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Blocker Report | 2 minutes | Help immediately |
| Confirmation | 1 minute | Acknowledge and coordinate |
| Status Update | 5 minutes | Review and respond if needed |
| Task Complete | 3 minutes | Verify and start dependent tasks |
| Code Commit | 10 minutes | Review and provide feedback |
| User Message | Immediate | Drop everything and respond |

## üéØ PRODUCTIVITY METRICS

**Track your monitoring effectiveness:**

**File:** `.manus-coordination/manus_[X]_metrics.json`

```json
{
  "date": "2025-10-02",
  "monitoring_cycles": 150,
  "signals_detected": 5,
  "response_time_avg": "90 seconds",
  "preparation_work_completed": [
    "Reviewed 10 files",
    "Created 3 plans",
    "Optimized 2 functions",
    "Updated 5 docs"
  ],
  "idle_time": "0 minutes",
  "productive_time": "100%"
}
```

---

## üö® NEVER DO THIS

**‚ùå Don't:**
- Sit idle waiting for confirmations
- Only check files once
- Wait passively for signals
- Ignore preparation work
- Let time go to waste
- Be unresponsive to signals

**‚úÖ Do:**
- Continuously monitor files
- Prepare for upcoming work
- Optimize existing code
- Update documentation
- Stay ready to respond
- Be proactive, not reactive

---

## üí° EXAMPLE: MANUS #2 MONITORING SESSION

```
22:25:00 - Scan coordination files ‚Üí No new signals
22:25:30 - Review AI agent code ‚Üí Found optimization opportunity
22:27:00 - Optimize Innovation AI performance
22:29:00 - Scan coordination files ‚Üí No new signals
22:29:30 - Review Frazer Method requirements
22:31:00 - Create test cases for CRM features
22:33:00 - Scan coordination files ‚Üí SIGNAL: Manus #1 confirmed!
22:33:30 - Respond to Manus #1 immediately
22:34:00 - Update coordination status
22:34:30 - Start monitoring Manus #1's work
22:35:00 - Scan coordination files ‚Üí Continue monitoring
```

**Result: 0% idle time, 100% productive, immediate response to signals**
