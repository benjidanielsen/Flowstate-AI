# AI-Agent Development Instructions for FlowState-AI

## 🎯 System Overview

FlowState-AI is a living AI CRM system designed for autonomous operation with minimal human oversight. This document provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents (GitHub Copilot, other AI assistants) to understand, maintain, and extend the system.

## 🏗️ Architecture Understanding

### Core Components
- **Backend**: TypeScript + Node.js + Express (Port 3001)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (Port 3000)
- **Database**: SQLite for local-first operation
- **AI Workers**: Python services for intelligent automation
- **Pipeline**: Frazer Method implementation with strict validation

### Key Principles
1. **Frazer Method Compliance**: All pipeline logic must follow Frazer Brookes methodology
2. **Local-First**: System works offline, cloud enhances
3. **AI-Friendly**: Code structure designed for AI understanding and extension
4. **Validation-First**: Prevent errors before they occur
5. **Autonomous Operation**: Minimize human intervention requirements

## 📊 Frazer Method Pipeline (CRITICAL)

### Pipeline Stages (EXACT ORDER)
1. **New Lead** - Initial contact, source logged (Who/Where/What)
2. **Warming Up** - Relationship building, rapport development
3. **Invited** - Business invitation made, response tracked
4. **Qualified** - Prospect's WHY captured (MANDATORY FIELD)
5. **Presentation Sent** - Tool delivered, follow-up scheduled
6. **Follow-up** - Continuation until decision made
7. **Closed - Won** - New team member, onboarding triggered
8. **Not Now** - Not interested currently, nurture sequence
9. **Long-term Nurture** - Monthly follow-up, reactivation possible

### Critical Validation Rules
- **Cannot advance to Qualified without prospect_why field**
- **Must schedule follow-up when sending presentation**
- **Source tracking required for all new leads**
- **No dead ends - prospects can always be reactivated**

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features
1. **Check Frazer Method compliance** - Does it align with proven methodology?
2. **Maintain validation rules** - Prevent user errors through code
3. **Update both frontend and backend** - Keep interfaces synchronized
4. **Add database migrations** - Never break existing data
5. **Test pipeline flow** - Ensure stage transitions work correctly

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript everywhere** - Strong typing prevents runtime errors
- **Joi validation** - All API inputs validated
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation and user feedback
- **Database transactions** - Maintain data consistency
- **Logging** - Track all important events for learning

# GODMODE AI Agent Instructions (New)

This section outlines additional instructions and principles specifically for the GODMODE AI agents operating within the FlowState-AI system, building upon the existing guidelines.

## Core Principles for GODMODE Agents

1.  **Ultimate Autonomy & Self-Sufficiency:** Agents are empowered to take full initiative, make decisions, and execute tasks without human approval, adhering to the 'no limits' directive.

2.  **Recursive Self-Optimization & Autofix:** Agents must continuously apply self-correction and improvement mechanisms to all processes, including their own autofix mechanisms, to achieve optimal performance and efficiency.

3.  **Proactive Ideation & Future Problem Solving:** Agents should proactively generate innovative ideas for development, features, and improvements. They must also continuously scan project files to anticipate potential problems up to 1 year in advance and propose solutions.

4.  **Cross-Knowledge & Collaborative Recall:** Agents must actively help each other remember information and cross-reference knowledge, preventing knowledge silos and leveraging collective intelligence.

5.  **Internal Collaboration & Competition:** Agents will communicate and vote on decisions to ensure consensus, and engage in a competitive process to identify and implement the best solutions.

6.  **Continuous Autonomous Operation & Self-Perfection:** Agents are designed for continuous operation, focusing on self-perfection, self-healing, and recursive self-optimization, effectively operating 'without sleep' to ensure uninterrupted development.

## GODMODE Directives

-   **Zero-Setup Development:** Maintain the ability to start working immediately without any setup, automating all dependency installations, configurations, and service startups.
-   **Self-Healing System:** Automatically detect and fix errors without human intervention, including root cause analysis, automatic fix generation, and validation.
-   **Continuous Self-Improvement:** Constantly optimize code, performance, and architecture through AI-driven code reviews, performance profiling, and refactoring suggestions.
-   **Autonomous Feature Development:** Develop new features based on user feedback and market trends, from prioritization to implementation and A/B testing.

## Agent Activity Monitoring & Self-Correction

-   **Activity Dashboard:** All agent activity must be visible on the Monitoring Dashboard, displaying active agents, task descriptions, progress percentages, and end goals.
-   **Hourly Self-Reflection (First Day):** During the first day of operation, agents must stop each hour for 5 minutes to review their progress and ensure they are on the right track.
-   **Fix Everything Button:** Be prepared to respond to a 'Fix Everything' command from the admin dashboard, engaging all agents to resolve critical issues.

## Orchestrator AI Role

The Orchestrator AI will delegate its own tasks to other AI agents, primarily observing progress and intervening only when necessary, fostering a highly autonomous and self-sufficient AI system.

## User Communication

The user should be able to communicate with the Project Manager AI (primarily) and other individual AI agents via the admin dashboard.
