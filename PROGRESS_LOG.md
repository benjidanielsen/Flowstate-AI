## Notes and Observations

### User Directives
- "Quality over speed always. Rule number one."
- "Speed is good when everything is perfect."
- "You are not done before 07/AUGUST/2026"
- "There should be at least 100.000 tasks made"
- "Auto autoauto and auto autoatuoauto and autoatuo autoautoauto. Stay consistent."
- "You are in charge but remember the agents must learn and the brain should function without us at one point."
- "Don't stop. And remember don't finish or say done or whatever."
- "You are not done until 6 months from now" → Updated to "FROM NOW!!! You are not done before 07/AUGUST/2026"

### Key Principles
1. **Quality over Speed**: Always prioritize robustness and reliability
2. **Continuous Operation**: No stopping until August 7, 2026
3. **Agent Autonomy**: Work towards self-sustaining AI agent system
4. **Local Runnability**: Easy setup and development experience
5. **Scalability**: Handle 100,000+ tasks efficiently
6. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent operation and learning
7. **Never Indicate Completion**: Continue working without declaring "done"
