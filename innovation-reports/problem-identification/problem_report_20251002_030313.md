## Summary of Findings

| Severity | Type | File | Line | Description | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Hardcoded Credentials | README.md | 79 | Hardcoded credentials are a security risk. | **Problem**: Hardcoded credentials are a security risk. (Severity: CRITICAL)<br>**Location**: README.md:L79<br>**Context**: `export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"`<br><br>**Proposed Solution**: Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Update the code to retrieve the value using `os.getenv()` or similar secure methods. Ensure the `.env` file is not committed to version control.<br> |
| CRITICAL | Hardcoded Credentials | README.md | 80 | Hardcoded credentials are a security risk. | **Problem**: Hardcoded credentials are a security risk. (Severity: CRITICAL)<br>**Location**: README.md:L80<br>**Context**: `# On Windows, use: set GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"`<br><br>**Proposed Solution**: Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Update the code to retrieve the value using `os.getenv()` or similar secure methods. Ensure the `.env` file is not committed to version control.<br> |
| HIGH | Outdated Dependencies | package.json | 21 | Outdated dependencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues. | **Problem**: Outdated dependencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.
